<h1>No Easy Love Affair: Copyright and Money</h1>
<p>How‚Äôs being an artist working out for you financially? In this day and age, when copyright legislation is stronger than ever, there‚Äôs still quite a chance you‚Äôre struggling to make ends meet. From that perspective, copyright is just one of the many ways you‚Äôre not making money!</p>
<p>The reasons for the precarity of artists are many. An economist would bring it back to the simplistic question of supply and demand. It‚Äôs a profession that is uniquely attractive to many people. Art also comes with few regulations and a low barrier to entry; if you won‚Äôt work for cheap, someone else probably will. Chances are, you‚Äôre willing to put up with a lot of hardship just to be able to continue to practice. You might even be working another job to subsidise the financially-unrewarding time you spend working as an artist. This could be an unrelated job or a related one such as art teaching. At the same time, both governments and private entities seem to find artists valuable enough to subsidise through grants, stipends and private patronage.<sup>üìö Hans Abbing, <em>Why Are Artists Poor? The Exceptional Economy of the Arts</em>.</sup></p>
<p>Regardless how much money your creative practice generates or not, you might be interested in making more. And since justifications for intellectual property often run along the line of ‚Äúartists need to eat,‚Äù it makes sense to figure out to what extent copyright can help you do so. To understand how you can make money with copyright, it‚Äôs important to understand what copyright is not. Copyright is not money you receive in exchange for labour, and it is not money you receive in exchange for goods. Copyright is the possibility of receiving money in exchange for reproductions. When someone pays you to make a performance, they pay you for the labour; when they want to show the performance again with another performer or when a local television network wants to broadcast a recording of the initial performance, they pay you for the copyright. When someone buys a sculpture from you, they pay you for the object; when a <em>Kunsthalle</em> puts a picture of your sculpture on a postcard, they pay you for the copyright.</p>
<h2>Copyright across media</h2>
<p>The role of copyright is not the same for every kind of artist. It changes depending on whether what you sell is reproductions, objects or labour.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre a graphic designer, for example, you tend to create new work on demand, so you primarily bill the client for the work of creating the design. However, your client will usually also want the right to reproduce and possibly modify your design, so part of your invoice will be for the copyright (for details, see chapter 5.3, <em>Mixed Authorship is the Norm: Graphic Design</em>). It could be, however, that part of your design practice is illustrations and typefaces that you market by themselves. In this case, whether you license them to a stock image portfolio, a type-foundry or set up your own website, copyright protects you were others to reproduce your work without permission.</p>
<p>As a visual artist working with a gallery, you are part of a fascinating system that, like copyright, responds to the mechanical reproducibility of art but in a wholly different way. Some works of art like paintings are unique, sellable objects by default. And galleries can classify other kinds of objects as unique, too. For example, the gallerist and artist might decide that a digital video is available in an edition of three, which means only three buyers receive a certificate of authenticity from the gallery guaranteeing they own a true copy of the work of art. This effectively trust-based system is not based on copyright but rather on contracts drawn up for the occasion. That said, you can still use copyright to prevent certain reproductions of your work and receive a remuneration for others, whether that‚Äôs for reproductions in magazines or in screenings, or in any number of derivative products like posters and t‚Äëshirts.</p>

You don‚Äôt make originals, but you make works that can be (in the case of the musician) streamed, downloaded, broadcasted, pressed onto vinyl or (in the case of the writer) reproduced in a book, magazine, blog or e-book. You should have a keen understanding of copyright because it will be the subject of the contracts you sign with publishers (see chapter 3.2, <em>Mutual Dependency: Publishers</em>). If a visual artist launches themselves into publishing an artists‚Äô book or monograph, the same considerations as those for writers and musicians come into play.</p>
<p>To sum up, we could say copyright is most important when you self-initiate a project and make use of a medium that allows for the easy reproduction and sales of copies (like, for example, this book). When time and effort have been invested into your work up front, the hope is to see it rewarded by the selling of copies. Visual artists also invest time and effort but, in so doing, create originals whose reproduction tends more to heighten the value of the original than diminish it. Copyright is less central to the revenue of applied artists, who are usually paid for time not expression, but it‚Äôs still worth knowing about.</p>
<h2>Every medium is different</h2>
<p>Differences between the various fields of art are of course fluid. The hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, aware of the diminishing market for recorded music, adopted a fine arts strategy for their album <em>Once Upon a Time in Shaolin</em> (2015). Whereas the market for recorded music has been in decline since 1999, the market for twentieth-century visual art showed extreme growth, especially in the first half of the 2010s. Clan member Tarik ‚ÄúCilvaringz‚Äù Azzougarh was well aware of this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to take music back to the days when a record was a moment in life to remember. The longevity of a record just doesn‚Äôt exist anymore in the era of downloading, and, in many cases, music has been devalued to the point of it being free. Artists such as Beethoven and Mozart are held in the same high esteem as Picasso and Michelangelo, so why can‚Äôt Dr Dre or RZA have a similar value to a US$50 million painting by Andy Warhol? That pushed me to come up with this idea, and figure the only difference is exclusivity. There‚Äôs only one painting, and you can‚Äôt duplicate it, so I decided to take a music album and limit it to one copy in the same way.<sup>üìÉ Chris Newbould, <em>Creating Music Fit for Museums</em>.</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wu-Tang Clan recorded the double album to be released in an edition of one. It sold through the online auction site Paddle8 for an alleged two million US dollars to an anonymous buyer. The buyer turned out to be ‚Äúthe most hated man in America,‚Äù pharmaceutical price gouger and hedge-fund fraudster Martin Shkreli. Every business model has its downsides.<sup>üìÉ Allie Conti, <em>Wine, Wu‚ÄëTang, and Pharmaceuticals: Inside Martin Shkreli‚Äôs World</em>.</sup></p>
<p>Taking into account the differences between artistic mediums is essential if you are involved in a debate over copyright. It‚Äôs easy to only think from the perspective of one‚Äôs own practice. One of the more prominent copyright infringement cases in recent Belgian history has made this clear. The well-known painter Luc Tuymans made a painting based on a press photograph and sold it to a private collector. As Tuymans had not asked for permission to reproduce her photograph, the photographer in question, Katrijn van Giel, sued for damages. Visual artists and art historians rushed to Tuymans‚Äô side. Apparently artistic freedom was under attack! Artists Lieven Segers and Tom Liekens organised a group show with 150 artists in protest. Yet reactions from the community of photographers were quite different. The Belgian Association of Professional Photographers condemned Tuymans. Photographer Michiel Hendryckx had no hesitations in denouncing Tuymans‚Äô action as intellectual plunder on national television.<sup>üì∫ <em>Michiel Hendryckx: ‚ÄòTuymans Doet Aan Intellectuele Roof‚Äô</em>.</sup> This is notable for, among photographers, Hendryckx is hardly a copyright hard-liner‚Äî
he has gifted a significant part of his back-catalogue to the public domain and made it available on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The only way to understand the opposing reactions from visual artists and from photographers is to understand how the business models of the two differ and how copyright functions differently for each. As a freelance photographer, Katrijn Van Giel lives off the reproductions of her oeuvre. She has no originals to sell. Tuymans, on the other hand, sells unique paintings. If the painting is reproduced, in many cases it will simply add to the aura of the original. Copyright has no meaningful role in his practice.</p>
