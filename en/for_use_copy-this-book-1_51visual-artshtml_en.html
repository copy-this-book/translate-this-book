<h1>In Love With the Copy: Visual Arts</h1>
<p>Walk through an art school and chances are you‚Äôll encounter plaster casts of ancient sculptures. Students used to learn to draw, paint and sculpt by copying such copies. It‚Äôs the advice Anton Mauve gave Vincent van Gogh in 1882, who himself preferred to paint the working class people he met in the street.<sup>üìö Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, <em>Vincent van Gogh: The Life</em>.</sup></p>
<p>Van Gogh has come to exemplify the romantic idea of the artist: visionary, solitary and original. The above anecdote fits that clich√© perfectly. Yet, five years after he received Mauve‚Äôs advice, Van Gogh admitted to his brother (while producing a series of reinterpretations that became some of his most well-known works) that copying teaches and consoles him.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, many of the plaster collections in art schools were destroyed in a wave of iconoclasm. The social changes of this period seemed to promise a future of such radical newness that the copying of old masters had little place. It‚Äôs also in this period that the social role of the image starts to change drastically. Compared to previous generations, artists are surrounded by an extraordinary number of images from different times, made for different purposes and by both professionals and amateurs.</p>
<p>How enticing, then, to make use of these images as motifs, starting points, illustrations, sources? A number of art movements from pop to appropriation to the figurative painters of the 1990s did exactly this. The bad news is that what is common artistic practice is prohibited by copyright. Without permission of the author, you cannot copy an image.</p>
<h2>But it‚Äôs art</h2>
<p>There are exceptions to copyright but art is not one of them. That is because all creative expressions are protected by copyright. In the <em>Guardian</em>, Adrian Searle‚Äôs defence of Luc Tuymans starts by mentioning that he is ‚Äúone of Europe‚Äôs leading and most influential painters.‚Äù Images for him are ‚Äújust a starting point.‚Äù A commenter on the forum puts it more bluntly: ‚ÄúAs artists, we reserve the right to utilise whatever material and lexicon we find in the world as material for new expression. Why wouldn‚Äôt a photograph, in a public forum as a newspaper no less [<em>sic</em>], be legitimate fodder for art.‚Äù<sup>üìÉ Adrian Searle, <em>Why Belgium‚Äôs Plagiarism Verdict on Luc Tuymans Is beyond Parody</em>.</sup></p>
<p>This kind of opposition between art and other expressions is lazy thinking. It devalues the creative labour at the heart of the source images (‚Äújust a starting point‚Äù, ‚Äúfodder‚Äù), that have also been made by (applied) artists. Personally, I like to think of such works as asynchronous collaborations, where each artist has added something of value. Whether it‚Äôs art or not is a question of context; photographers might publish photos in newspapers and also have exhibitions in galleries.</p>
<p>It remains true that artistic freedom is restricted by copyright and this is precisely because all artists are afforded such strong rights to protect their work. Hence, you have to ask for permission, which you might not get or which you might not be able to afford. We‚Äôll never know what David Bowie‚Äôs musical version of <em>1984</em> (1949) would have been like. As a culture, perhaps we deny ourselves lots of interesting productions by giving artists such far-reaching power.</p>
<h2>But I didn‚Äôt make money</h2>
<p>Another common misconception about how copyright works is that if you make no money there is no infringement. Legally, this is false. Starving artists can still find themselves at the receiving end of a lawsuit. A judge may only take into account the revenue generated when determining the height of the damages owed. In the United States, the situation is slightly different. Whether or not a work falls in the category of ‚Äúfair use‚Äù is in part determined by whether there are monetary gains.</p>
<p>In practice, the risk of lawsuits does get bigger the more money you make as an artist. On the one hand, this is because you lose some of the goodwill associated with being young and struggling. After all, lawsuits are filed by human beings, often artists themselves, who are sensitive to other arguments than those that are strictly legal. More importantly, with fame comes more visibility, which increases the chances that the person whose work has been appropriated will find out about it. Art Rogers, the photographer who successfully sued Jeff Koons, discovered Koons‚Äô sculptural appropriation of his photograph when the latter reached the front page of the Los Angeles Times‚Äô Sunday calendar.<sup>üìÉ James Traub, <em>Art Rogers vs. Jeff Koons</em>.</sup></p>
<p>So if, like most artists, you are working, exhibiting and selling within a relatively restricted social sphere, chances are you can use existing images without running into problems. That said, the security through obscurity that protected the majority of visual art from lawsuits in the past is eroding because of the internet. Pictures of an exhibition visited by several dozen people will linger online. Reverse image search engines make it possible for rights-holders to find out about reuses. Finally, the European Commission‚Äôs latest copyright reform, the <em>Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market</em>, will require web platforms to work proactively at preventing copyright infringement, which could well result in automatic copyright filtering on social networks. The copyright laws that are presently barely enforced in visual arts will make their presence felt more strongly in the future.</p>
<h2>But I made something new</h2>
<p>Many artists share a common intuition that it‚Äôs not bad to copy someone as long as you make something new out of it and especially if you credit the original. This view has some things going for it. For one, since you did not simply replicate the work, yours does not enter in direct competition with the original; nobody will mistake your work for the work you copied. It seems to fit with how creativity works: we don‚Äôt create from abstract ideas but react to the concrete forms that surround us. Unfortunately, copyright law does not care. A small number of exceptions notwithstanding, it is not possible to copy an existing work without asking permission and that‚Äôs true even when you use it to make something new.</p>
<p>So, what is a copy? The way in which copyright works is to protect specific creative expressions. Once you‚Äôve made a photograph or a drawing, no-one can copy or even adapt it without permission. But that rule does not apply for the procedure or style with which you made the image. That‚Äôs why every historical period eventually finds itself expressed in a Photoshop filter. In other words, it‚Äôs no problem to make a work in the style of another work, you just can‚Äôt copy. The forger Geert Jan Jansen got so adept at imitating the style of Karel Appel that Appel himself certified a number of Jansen‚Äôs works thinking he himself painted them. Since getting caught, Jansen now exhibits paintings ‚Äúin the style of‚Äù the artists whose style he inhabits.<sup>üìö Geert Jan Jansen, <em>Magenta: avonturen van een meestervervalser</em>.</sup></p>
<p>So, when is a copy still a copy? If I make a drawing after a photograph, for example, do I still need permission? Most probably, yes. A drawing of a photograph is considered a derivative work as long as the form of the original is still recognisable in your copy.</p>

<p>If your style of art-making leads you to use photographic sources, legally speaking, what would be best is to make your own photo of your subject. But not every subject is easy to access. Hence, when the Dutch public fund for visual art and cultural heritage, the Mondriaan Fund, asked a number of artists to make a proposal for a portrait of the king, they provided a number of photographs as source material. But they still got into trouble when Iris Van Dongen based her royal portrait on a photo by Koos van Breukel that she found on Google Images.<sup>üìÉ Arjen Ribbens, <em>Fotograaf: kunstenares pleegt plagiaat met staatsieportret</em>.</sup> Just like you can‚Äôt walk up to the king and take his picture, you can‚Äôt visit the past or travel to every location that interests you. It can thus be difficult or even impossible to produce your own source photographs all the time. In such cases, you should either get a license for an existing image or find as many sources as possible in order to work from a mental image.</p>
<p>In many cases, you may not only care about the subject-matter of an image but also about its qualities. Some representations become iconic and it is by copying them that you add to an ongoing cultural conversation. In this case, there are only two options: Hope to fly under the radar or get a license.</p>
<p>Artists do obtain license agreements. Once your artwork is more visible, the risk of lawsuits increases and you might attempt to negotiate a license for the images upon which it is based. Artists that do this don‚Äôt usually like to talk about it. Notably for artists recognised as appropriation artists, the idea of simply taking whichever images they fancy may constitute a personal and art historical mythology. Such artists actually negotiate behind the scenes. It‚Äôs often said that today Andy Warhol couldn‚Äôt make the work that first made him famous but actually Warhol was already getting into lawsuits in the 1960s. For many of his later artworks, Warhol worked with the rights-holders of the original images on which his screen-prints and paintings were based. Mike Bidlo has secured the rights for his reappropriations. Even Richard Prince, who is famous for getting away with reusing photos without permission, sought permission for some of his works. Prince paid photographer Gary Gross for the right to use his photograph of the 10-year-old Brooke Shields standing naked in a bath tub.<sup>üìÉ Laura Gilbert, <em>No Longer Appropriate?</em></sup></p>
<h2>Being copied</h2>
<p>Like we explored in the chapter <em>No Easy Love Affair: Copyright and Money</em>, chances are that as a visual artist you don‚Äôt primarily depend on copyright for income. Both commissioned works and works sold through a gallery are part of a market modelled on physical artefacts. Within the gallery system, even the market for multiples like digital movies and prints of photos is regulated through certificates of authenticity rather than through copyright licenses. Your secondary income is more likely to come from related work (e.g., teaching, designing) and grants than from copyright licensing. Given all that, how do you handle being copied?</p>
<p>What‚Äôs important to know is that copyright grants you the discretion to figure it out on a case-by-case basis. That means you don‚Äôt have to be as strict as the letter of the law. If you‚Äôre being copied and you‚Äôre OK with that, you are not obliged to do anything. When Marlene Dumas copied a photograph by Andre van Noord, he was honoured (it probably helped that they knew each other and Dumas had bought a print).<sup>üìÉ Mischa Cohen, <em>Foto‚Äôs schilderen: plagiaat of ‚Äòfair use‚Äô?</em></sup> You can also choose to exert only part of the powers the law allows, for example, by asking to be properly credited without asking for damages. In some cases, the copy presents a real commercial interest. Fast fashion retailers like Zara and Forever 21 play loose with copyright and habitually include illustrations they find on Tumblr and Instagram. If Zara laser-cuts your line-drawing into a purse, you might find it interesting to consider your legal options (see chapter 4.1, <em>The Coin Has Two Sides: Suing and Getting Sued</em>).</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested in creating additional income by licensing your work, an option to consider is joining an artist rights association. Whenever someone is interested in licensing your work, you refer them to the organisation and they negotiate the contract for you. Additionally, in many countries there are collective licensing agreements, which can means artist rights organisations collect fees and levies from libraries and companies that make photocopies or from consumers who buy blank hard disks and mp3 players. It‚Äôs only through joining a rights organisation that you have access to a part of this money. Finally, they can be invaluable when you need to deal with infringers because you don‚Äôt have to pay fees for legal advice beyond those of your membership.</p>
<h2>Fair use</h2>
<p>Since the United States is an important player in the art world, searching for information on art and copyright will quickly produce information written from a US perspective. One of the reasons visual artists are not always aware of the legal restrictions of copyright is that the situation is different in the United States.</p>
<p>The legal climate in the United States is more forgiving for artists who reuse. Most notably, the US have this concept of ‚Äúfair use.‚Äù Re-using a copyrighted work might be possible depending on four factors: the purpose and character of the use (is it transformative), the nature of the copyrighted work (if the work relies heavily on facts, like a biography does, it allows for more copying), the amount used (how much of the work is re-used) and the possible impact on market value of the original work. There are no hard and fast rules. In case of a conflict, it‚Äôs finally a judge who decides if a work is within fair use or not. <sup><em>üìÉ Measuring Fair Use: The Four Factors</em>.</sup>Inevitably, fair use provisions make possible a lot of the practices that today make up the visual arts.</p>
<p>In Europe, the law is much stricter.<sup>üìÉ Julien Cabay and Maxime Lambrecht, <em>Remix Prohibited: How Rigid EU Copyright Laws Inhibit Creativity</em>.</sup> As you can see in chapter 2.1, <em>The Rights to Your Expressions: The Basics of Copyright</em>, exceptions to copyright do exist. Parodies are possible, but they need to have a mocking or humorous goal and start from a well known work. Quotations are possible, but only for specific purposes. These are not the only exceptions: the EU‚Äôs 2001 copyright directive includes a long list of exceptions member states can implement, covering all kinds of scenarios from scientific research to religious celebrations. But none of these exceptions cover the transformative adaptation or appropriation of an existing image so common in arts today.</p>
