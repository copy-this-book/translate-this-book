<h1>The Rights to Your Expressions: The Basics of Copyright</h1>
<p>What follows is the story of copyright. As humans, we share the realm of abstract ideas. What artists do, so the story goes, is to take an abstract idea and make a series of creative choices informed by their personality in order to create an expression that is the artistic work. Because your personality is unique, your artistic work is original. And because the work is so tightly tied to your personality, you should be allowed to have some control over it. And because copyright was invented by writers and publishers, not by painters, the control that you have is not over the physical object through which your expression is fixed, but over its copies.</p>
<p>Once you are recognised as the author of something, copyright ensures you are the one who decides who can copy it. Copyright law says nothing about getting paid, but the underlying assumption is that you can leverage copyright by asking for compensation from whoever wants to publish or republish your work. Needless to say, the power of an artist to choose a publisher is not only about money. Often the publisher will play an important role in the creative process. A given publisher will also speak to a certain crowd and come with a certain image. Being able to choose how and where you publish is an important part of the work.</p>
<p>Next to regulating the copies of a work, copyright also regulates the reuse of your copyrighted work in a new work by another author. Most forms of sampling, adaptation and appropriation are, as far as copyright is concerned, still copies. The expected benefit is double-edged. On the one hand it is economic‚Äîyou can profit from attention to your work by selling, for example, the film rights to a text you wrote or the reproduction rights to an image you created. On the other hand, the benefit is artistic control‚Äîyou can limit who gets to reuse the work and to what extent, in which case your rights limit those of other artists.</p>
<p>Thus, another dimension of how copyright affects your work: you will have to deal with other artists‚Äô copyright. In the realm of copyright, other works and artistic heritage don‚Äôt really exist. Your inspiration is supposed to come from the realm of abstract ideas, not from the concrete forms that make up culture and its history. If you incorporate existing images, text or music into your work, you will have to ask permission from the original artist or from whichever intermediary or publisher now holds the copyright. Whether they grant this or not is up to them. It could be the case that they simply do not want you to use their work, or perhaps, even if they do, the compensation they ask is prohibitively expensive. These are the ways in which copyright limits artistic freedom.</p>
<h2>What gets to be copyrighted?</h2>
<p>Not all human activity is subject to copyright. In delimiting the protected work, the most widely-employed copyright treaty, the Berne Convention, uses the term ‚Äúliterary and artistic works.‚Äù It defines this as ‚Äúevery production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression.‚Äù<sup>‚öñ <em>Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works</em>.</sup></p>
<p>The expression ‚Äúproduction in the literary, scientific and artistic domain‚Äù may seem to restrict the scope of copyright to the context of professional creative production, but that‚Äôs not really the case. Judges have been reticent to arbitrate what works belong to the artistic domain because they would then have to determine who is an artist and who is not. A more open definition has come to be employed. Judges ask: Does the expression in question show the imprint of a personality? And because that sounds vague, here‚Äôs another way to phrase it: Is the expression the result of a number of free and creative choices by a human being (yes, copyright is species-ist<sup>Animals cannot have copyright, but they can have agency. So if an animal takes a picture, there is no copyright, neither for the animal nor for its human handler. This is what British nature photographer David Slater found out when a Celebes crested macaque used his camera to make the infamous ‚Äòmonkey selfies‚Äô.</sup>)? You don‚Äôt have to consider yourself an artist, be validated as such, or even consider what you do as art to get copyright. Your holiday snapshots and the drawings made in creative therapy all have copyright, as do everyone else‚Äôs.</p>
<p>When your work resembles the prototypical, autonomous work of art it is easy to show it required creative choices. Today, if you‚Äôve fashioned a painting, a sonnet or a composition for flute and two violins, no-one will doubt that copyright applies. However, when the artistic outcome derives from an automatic process, copyright doubts mount. This is why photography was initially not considered under copyright protection, it was thought to be only a technical procedure rather than a creative gesture. Over time, photographers were able to convince the public and judges that their work did indeed require creative choices. Nowadays, every photograph gets copyright protection, as long as it involves freedom in choosing the composition (see chapter 5.6, <em>A Copy of Reality:</em> <em>Photographs</em>).</p>
<p>It‚Äôs quite difficult to copyright short phrases and simple shapes. Everyday objects whose form derives from their function, such as hammers and nails, might also not be under copyright, unless they are extravagantly ornamented. Facts cannot be copyrighted; anyone is free to mention this book‚Äôs file archive weighs in at 8 megabytes, it doesn‚Äôt matter who writes it down first. Though, in the EU a collection of facts can be protected through something called sui generis database rights. In other words, while I can consult and copy the bibliographic record of this book in a library, I cannot code a software program that downloads the entire catalogue. Scientific theories cannot be copyrighted; they are supposed to represent the way the world is, not an individual vision. A text in which such a theory is described can get copyright, however. Recipes also don‚Äôt have copyright, even if a cookbook can have copyright for the particular language in which a recipe is described.</p>
<p>For much of the twentieth century, artists have been busy trying to question notions of originality and authorship. Early examples, like the readymades of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven or Marcel Duchamp, see creative choice reduced to designating a pre-existing functional object a work of art. It‚Äôs highly unlikely that these works are protected by copyright. While arguably Duchamp‚Äôs replicas from the 1960s display a modicum of creative choice in the placement and lettering of the signature, there is conversely nothing stopping anyone from buying a urinal and designating it as a work of art today.</p>

CC0 1.0, courtesy of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.</figcaption></figure><p>Copyright tries to make a strict distinction between expression and idea, where the expression is copyrighted and the idea is not. In practice it‚Äôs difficult to separate the two, with the possible exception of conceptual art. If in conceptual art the idea constitutes the work of art, the concept in conceptual art cannot be copyrighted. Only the form in which the concept is documented or fixated can be. For example, as far as we know, it‚Äôs Piero Manzoni who came up with the idea that putting an upside-down plinth on the ground creates a pedestal for the world. This idea is not protected; you can sculpt an upside-down plinth yourself. The thing you cannot do is make exactly the same pedestal Manzoni did. That‚Äôs why Sophie Calle and Vito Acconci could both follow strangers in the street and document this activity in text and photographs. The idea of following strangers in the street and documenting it cannot be copyrighted. In this case, it is the documentation rather than the artistic intervention that has copyright. If you work on ephemeral conceptual projects like these and you work with a photographer to document them, the photographer may even be the only person who has the copyright of your work!</p>
<h2>Who has copyright?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It is certainly worth examining how the author became individualised in European culture, what status he or she has been given, at what moment studies of authenticity and attribution began, in what kind of system of valorisation the author is involved, at what point we began to recount the lives of authors rather than of heroes, and how this fundamental category of ‚Äúthe-man-and-his-work criticism‚Äù began.<sup>üìö Michel Foucault, <em>What Is an Author?</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being the author is a privilege. As an author you get rights over what you make, whereas as a worker what you make belongs to your boss or your customer. If you‚Äôre identified as the author of a work, not only do you have copyright you can exploit, you are also the first person anyone will ask to explain and elucidate the work. Everything would seem to work easiest when there‚Äôs only one author. One person to receive the royalty cheques, one person for the journalists to interview. Yet to focus on that one author is to miss out on the complex social and artistic dynamics that allow a work to come into being. In both the legal system and the way we talk about creativity, it‚Äôs not easy to come to terms with the fact that every literary and artistic work is a collaboration.</p>
<p>Any book you find in a bookshop with one author‚Äôs name on the cover actually has multiple authors. Beyond the fact that a book such as this one is a patchwork of existing ideas, voices and tropes, it takes a team to arrive at a final text. In this case, I‚Äôve written all the chapters but several editors have advised me, a copy editor has edited the text for stylistic consistency and a proofreader has corrected mistakes. Legally, I could argue these collaborators are co-authors. The copy editor in particular really contributes to the form a text will take. Harder to argue would be the work of the editor and the publisher, which falls rather on the idea side of the idea/expression dichotomy, and that of the proofreader, whose work could be argued to be uncreative. Anyhow it is usually not in the interest of either the publisher or the author to acknowledge the copy editor‚Äôs contribution, invested as they may be in maintaining the myth of individual authorship.</p>
<p>Theoretically, copyright does work with multiple authors. Shared authorship means you share the copyright. If someone wants to copy a co-authored work, they have to ask all co-authors for permission. You will have to negotiate together how you share any revenue. Some of Marina Abramoviƒá‚Äôs striking performances from the 1970s and 1980s were made together with Ulay. In 2015 Ulay won a case that affirmed Abramoviƒá needed to share licensing revenue and keep crediting his contribution.<sup>üìÉ Ben Quinn and Noah Charney, <em>Marina Abramoviƒá Ex-Partner Ulay Claims Victory in Case about Joint Works</em>.</sup> In 2010 the Belgian couple Jimmy Kets and Mei Vandenberghe started working on a film together, with Vandenberghe as director and Kets as director of photography. After their breakup, Kets finished and marketed the movie as his own work, omitting all mention of Vandenberghe. In 2018 the Ghent court ruled that Kets was at fault and needed to pay damages.<sup>üìÉ Kim Van de Perre, <em>Een Coauteur Schrap Je Niet Ongestraft</em>; Anouk Eigenraam, <em>‚ÄòMijn ex-vriend heeft mijn film gestolen‚Äô</em>.</sup></p>
<p>Beyond two authors sharing one copyright, a lot of works are in fact a collage of many different copyrights. A single newspaper page might combine the copyright of journalists, type designers, graphic designers and photographers. To read more about how these rights work together, see chapter 5.3, <em>Mixed Authorship Is the Norm: Graphic Design</em>.</p>
<h2>How long does copyright last?</h2>
<p>Copyright lasts for a long time. At the moment, copyright will last your lifetime and continue after your death. Before the Berne Convention became the basis for most of the world‚Äôs copyright laws, some countries like the United States would calculate from the date of publication, however the date of the author‚Äôs death is the approach today.</p>
<p>The Berne Convention specifies a minimum of 50 years after the author‚Äôs death, with copyright ending on the 1<sup>st</sup> of January of the year following this anniversary. Most countries, including the US and the EU member states, have pushed it to 70 (see chapter 2.2, <em>No Ordinary Labour: Why Copyright</em>). The longest protection is provided by Mexico, where copyright ends 100 years after the author‚Äôs death. Andr√©s Henestrosa was born in 1906, published his first book at 22 and died in early 2008 at the age of 101. When his copyright expires on 1 January 2109, <em>Los hombres que dispers√≥ la danza</em> (1929) will have been under copyright in Mexico for 179 years.</p>
<p>Given the concept of copyright is so closely tied to the idea of the author, it seems strange that it can persist so long after they are gone. Only when you consider copyright as a property right that can be bought and sold does it make more sense. After all, physical possessions such as houses can stay in families indefinitely, or for as long as the next generation are able to pay inheritance tax and divide their dues. Taking this point of view, there are Hollywood lobbyists who have proposed a copyright term of forever minus a day!<sup>Minus one day because the US constitution demands that copyright terms be limited in time. The influential Hollywood lobbyist Jack Valenti came up with this idea. Congresswoman Mary Bono spoke positively of this plan in her defence of copyright extensions.</sup></p>
<p>Copyright doesn‚Äôt last forever because the rights afforded to you, the freedom to distribute the work as you like and potentially profit from it, come at the expense of the public‚Äôs access to the work. Work that doesn‚Äôt have copyright is more accessible because it can be published more easily. Additionally, other artists can freely and legally build upon that work. That‚Äôs why copyright is divided in two parts. The first being the period where copyright is in place and the artist can exploit the work to the best of their ability, and the second being the period where copyright expires or is ceded and anybody can copy, adapt and exploit the work. To find out what happens to works of art at this point, see chapter 6.1, <em>No Known Restrictions: the Public Domain</em>.</p>
<h2>How do you get copyright?</h2>
<p>As soon as you‚Äôve fashioned a creative work, its copyright is accorded to you automatically and instantly. You don‚Äôt need to register with a copyright office. You don‚Äôt need to add a ‚Äú¬©‚Äù symbol or a message about how copying is prohibited. That said, it can be useful to state who is the copyright holder, since then people know who to contact if they want to make a copy.</p>
<p>Since distribution rarely happens by itself, you will find yourself working with publishers, production companies, agencies, etc. In order for such bodies to make copies on your behalf, you can do one of two things: hand over your copyright in exchange for a cut in the earnings (‚Äúassigning copyright‚Äù); or provide permission to make copies, while still retaining copyright. To learn about the different options, see chapter 3.3, <em>Setting the Conditions of Copying: Licenses</em>.</p>
<p>Copyright is not only the concern of artists. Media companies make their money with copyright, too. One could even say more so than original creators. For artists tend to have diverse income sources wherein copyright is only one part (see chapter 3.1, <em>No Easy Love Affair: Copyright and Money</em>), whereas media companies can build business models solely around the reproduction of content. Further, such companies invest in many artists and can hedge their bets; one best-selling artist can compensate for a lot of less successful investments. Much of the lobbying for copyright tends to focus on how it benefits artists, presumably because the public is more sympathetic to the artistic plight than to that of multinational companies, but copyright is of course extremely important to the entertainment industry. Some parts of copyright law, like its long duration, are more important to industry than they are to individual artists‚Äîno-one is exactly well-positioned to profit from copyright after death.</p>
<p>If you assign copyright to a company or another individual, you typically let go of a large part of control over your work. It‚Äôs the new owner who can decide to accept translations or adaptations, and they who can license out your work to be reprinted or used in other contexts. Copyright is based on the idea of a tight link between author and work, but in the case of assigning copyright that link is broken: the author no longer controls the circulation of the work, someone else does. For this reason, some countries have put in place a number of rights to make sure the artist maintains some say over their work, even when copyright is signed away. These are called ‚Äúmoral rights‚Äù. The moral rights include the right to be recognised as the author of your work and for the integrity of the work to be respected (see chapter 2.3, <em>The Artist‚Äôs Honour: Moral Rights</em>). During your lifetime, the moral rights to a work always belong to you, even if you cede your copyright to a third party.</p>
<h2>When is a copy still a copy for copyright?</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre a writer or a press photographer, you deal almost exclusively with reproductions of your work. Without copyright, any publisher could republish your work as soon as it appears. There would be less incentive for publishers to pay for your work. In this sense, copyright responds to one of the challenges of the mechanical reproduction of art. But copyright also goes a step further and prohibits anyone from making an adaptation of your work, or adapting it to a new medium. Still, no-one needs to ask permission to make a work that‚Äôs in the same style as yours, that is inspired by it or that touches upon the same topics as it does. And nor do you need to ask permission when inspired by someone else. So, how do you tell the difference between adaptation and inspiration?</p>
<p>Again, copyright distinguishes between idea and expression. You need permission to reuse the expression, that is, the physical or digital form a work takes. This also holds for any reworking of the form, where the primary author‚Äôs work is still recognisable. Examples of such reworking are scaling down, cropping or filtering, but also (and this tends to surprise visual artists) drawing or painting after a photograph. Though it caused a stir in the art world, the 2015 verdict condemning Luc Tuymans for his painted copy of a photograph by Katrijn van Giel was pretty much in line with established European copyright practice (the appeal was settled out of court). More about this in chapter 5.1, <em>In Love With the Copy: Visual Arts</em>.</p>
<p>A translation is also an adaptation. For, while this work is clearly a creative undertaking, translators always take the author‚Äôs word as their point of departure. If, for a forthcoming video project, you are basing your work on an existing short story, following much the same plot or reusing dialogue, that probably counts as an adaptation and you have to ask permission. Although when David Bowie was denied permission to make a rock musical version of <em>1984</em> (1949), he still made the album <em>Diamond Dogs</em> (1974). The song titles of the latter directly reference George Orwell‚Äôs book and the lyrics allude to the dystopic story. Nevertheless, the lyrics don‚Äôt directly quote the text, the album doesn‚Äôt follow the plot and the original characters seem to have become gender-bending, drug-taking, party-loving street gang members.</p>
<p>Copyright has an exception for quotation. The problem is this exception is only truly reliable for text, as noted in chapter 5.2, <em>The Prototypical Author: Writing</em>. If you give proper attribution and the quote‚Äôs size remains accessory to the main text, it‚Äôs possible to quote copyrighted works. Quoting parts of images and excerpts of videos is possible in most EU member states, but not all. The EU‚Äôs current round of copyright reforms has done little to make for a more uniform and permissive landscape.</p>
<p>In many cases, then, reusing or adapting an existing work will require you to ask permission from the original author, or whoever now holds copyright. They might give you permission for free, they might make you pay or they might refuse altogether. When it comes to your own work, it‚Äôs you who has the power to decide. To read about how to receive or issue copyright licenses, see chapter 3.3.</p>
<p>One challenge, in the absence of clear quotation rights, is that if you make a collage using bits and pieces from many different works, you will have to clear copyright for all of them. The problem is that licensing fees add up. DJ Shadow, known for his 1999 album <em>Endtroducing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</em>, which featured compositions constructed entirely from layers of samples, notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lawyers make it totally impossible to clear more than one sample per song, because they all want 75 percent, no matter how big or how small the use is [‚Ä¶] If you come to them, they think, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs payday. We‚Äôve got them under a barrel.‚Äù If you use a hundred samples in a song, you can still only clear one or two, tops.<sup>üìÉ Kylee Swenson, <em>DJ Shadow: Collage Constructionist</em>.</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Faced with such legal challenges, many artists rely on another strategy: security through obscurity. That means trying to minimise the chance that a rights-holder will discover the infringement. Most art shows have a small audience, most art publications a small print run. The internet has an effect on this dynamic, though. On the one hand, it is becoming more common to publish online; on the other, internet platforms are introducing ways to automatically scan for copyrighted materials. Another approach is to modify, filter and otherwise distort your quotes to the point they are no longer recognisable. Of course, for any ‚Äúsecurity through obscurity‚Äù strategy to actually work, people have to stay silent about it. Dave Dorrell, one of the DJs working on the early British acid house track <em>Pump Up the Volume</em> (1987), mentioned his use of a sample in a radio interview and promptly received a legal injunction from songwriters Stock Aitken Waterman.<sup>üìÉ Richard Buskin, <em>Classic Tracks: MARRS ‚ÄòPump Up The Volume‚Äô</em>.</sup></p>
<p>Alternatives include working exclusively with artists who‚Äôve chosen to release their work openly and thereby applied a Creative Commons license (see chapter 3.3). Another option is to work with artists whose work is in the public
domain (see chapter 6.1).</p>
<h2>Does copyright apply everywhere?</h2>
<p>The exchange of culture has always happened irrespective of national borders‚Äîin fact, it happened long before the modern nation-state existed.</p>
<p>Given the international character of the exchange of and trade in culture, it is not surprising there have been a great number of attempts to make the various copyright regulations in the world correspond. The copyright regulations of most countries are the result of a large number of international treaties and trade agreements. It is practical that no matter where you are active and wherever you export your works, the laws governing them will have some resemblance. It is thanks to such international agreements that this book is possible. After all, it is written in English for an international audience and a large part of the concepts it explains are encoded into legal systems all around the world. The devil, however, is in the details. Today there are still plenty of differences between the copyright of the US and the copyright enacted by the EU member states and even between the various member states.</p>
<p>Of the 193 United Nations member states, 173 have ratified a copyright treaty originating in the nineteenth century, the Berne Convention, though all parties to the convention do not necessarily implement copyright in exactly the same way. The convention represents a particular approach to copyright via strong, long and immediate protection for authors; it is highly influential and constitutes the dominant legal tradition internationally (see chapter 2.2).</p>
<p>The harmonisation of copyright regulation worldwide has meant, in most cases, that the countries with weaker protection for authors have strengthened it to the level of the countries with more protection. Economically, the countries that have the most to gain from intellectual property laws are the countries that are net exporters of intellectual property. At the moment, this means the US and Europe. A controversial move on the part of these countries is the inclusion of intellectual property stipulations as part of trade agreements. For so-called emerging economies, access to these trade agreements brings economic opportunities. Thus, in order to have access to these opportunities, such countries must accept a strict intellectual property regime.Artists from the localities in question can potentially benefit: a hit song will now be afforded stronger protection domestically, and will also be protected if they manage to export it abroad. Yet it is more likely that the main winners of such regulations are the US and European media and pharmaceutical companies that lobbied for the laws in the first place, because both their legal and their marketing budgets are unmatched. Moreover, a part of the products sold by these multinationals are based on public domain knowledge from the countries that they can now start to operate in.</p>
<p>Curare, batik, myths and the dance <em>lambada</em> flow out of so-called developing countries, unprotected by intellectual property rights, while Prozac, Levis, Grisham and the movie <em>Lambada</em> (1990) flow in, protected by a suite of intellectual property laws, which in turn are backed by the threat of trade sanctions should anyone complain.<sup>üìö James Boyle, <em>Shamans, Software, and Spleens: Law and the Construction of the Information Society</em>.</sup></p>
<p>In the history of copyright, the US made an impressive pivot. From the outset, US copyright protection was basically protectionist‚Äîinternational treaties were not signed and copyright was only accorded to US-American authors. This was beneficial to the US economy, as they imported more copyrighted art than they exported. The US only started to sign treaties once its own cultural industries started developing.<sup>To be fair, other countries did exactly the same. The Netherlands signed on late to the Berne Convention, because it had a sizeable printing and publishing industry that published more foreign than domestic books.</sup> Even then, the US was hesitant to sign treaties with strong copyright protections like the Berne Convention. In the 1989, the entertainment industry managed to convince congress to ratify Berne. Once on board with Berne, the US became a driving force in enforcing strong copyright laws worldwide through subsequent agreements. The US effectively made a 180 degree switch on the internationalisation of copyright, and a switch in legal doctrine. As we‚Äôll see in the next chapter, the US position on why to have copyright law in the first place even changed.</p>
