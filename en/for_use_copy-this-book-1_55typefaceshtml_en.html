<h1>Too Useful to¬†Protect: Typefaces</h1>
<p>Typefaces, colloquially known as fonts, are a coherent set of letterforms that are used together to set text. Just like photography in the nineteenth century and software in the twentieth, their traditional link to technology made it unapparent that protections would apply for typefaces in the same way they do for fine art and writing.</p>
<h2>Legal protections</h2>
<p>Traditionally, copyright protection for typefaces has been very weak, especially in what has become the biggest market, the United States. In the reasoning of US congress, typefaces are utilitarian objects. If it‚Äôs useful, it can‚Äôt be art‚ÄîOscar Wilde would have been pleased. Each time one typeface becomes popular, other foundries create clones. Instead of Helvetica, you can use CG Triumvirate, Pragmatica, Swiss 721, Nimbus Sans or Europa Grotesk.<sup>üìÉ <em>I like Tight Pants and I¬†Need My Generic Font Medicine</em>.</sup> More interesting, in an artistic sense, is that type designers iterate the work of their colleagues. Some of the seminal twentieth-century typefaces are the result of designers consciously trying to create a better version of a pre-existing typeface. Helvetica is Akzidenz Grotesk updated to mid-century modern tastes; Gill Sans is a reworking of Edward Johnston‚Äôs eponymous London Underground typeface.<sup>üìÉ <em>I like Tight Pants and¬†No-One Starts from¬†Scratch: Type Design and the Logic of¬†the Fork</em>.</sup></p>
<p>With type design moving to the digital space, type has found a road to copyright protection in much the same way as software. A digital typeface is encoded as a collection of points, a kind of text that can be copyrighted. That is why end-user license agreements for fonts consistently use the words ‚Äúfont software‚Äù instead of ‚Äútypeface,‚Äù the copyright protection of software source-code is well established. An important legal detail is that while the encoding of a typeface is copyrighted, the design of it is not. If someone redraws a font while looking at the original, the resulting points will probably be different and constitute a new work in copyright terms.</p>
<figure><img src="../media/file26.png"></figure><p>If you‚Äôre a type designer, the lack of copyright protection might seem strange. Even if type design is guided by utilitarian restrictions, it is also creative, and it‚Äôs not so clear why it would generate less legal protection than other applied arts, like graphic design. A part of the answer might lie in the unintended consequences such protection could have, since type also remains a tool: with proper copyright protection for type designs, each printed page could become a derivative work of its typeface.</p>
<p>In recent decades, <em>community designs</em> have provided an alternative to copyright protection for industrial designs to which copyright might not apply. Without registration, this EU wide mechanism provides 3 years of protection, and with registration 25 years. In the US, there are <em>design patents</em>, but they require an expensive and time consuming application process. Only a few big foundries, like Adobe, have applied for design patents. A measure used by many companies is to apply for trademark protection for the names of fonts. While you‚Äôre free to make a digital version of Gill Sans, only Monotype Imaging can use the name, since they own the trademark.</p>
<h2>Licensing fonts</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre using typefaces, licensing them works in much the same way as it does for software. Because the font file itself can easily be copied, restrictions are in place in the licensing contract. When licensing typefaces, you can usually choose the number of computers on which it can be used. The fact that most printers now facilitate a PDF workflow has made the process much simpler. Before, when you sent layout files and fonts to a printer, you needed to take into account the computers used by the printer. Now you just need to count how many computers there are in your studio.</p>
<p>Licensing for digital media like ebooks, websites and apps is more complicated. For digital media, typefaces will have to be bundled along with the product. Initially many type-vendors were very hesitant to allow their typefaces to be used in such a way. They were afraid website visitors would find ways to download the fonts for themselves, a risk that does not exist for print production. It was almost a decade after the introduction of web fonts in mainstream browsers that well-known foundries started to make their fonts available for online use. Licensing models are often based on buying a font for a specific domain and the pricing depends on the number of visitors. License fees can be yearly rather than perpetual.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre licensing, you can choose between hosted and self-hosted models. In the former case, you link to the URL of a web font that is placed on an external service. Foundries like this model because it gives them more options to obfuscate the font in order to hide it from people who might want to download it. It is also useful for the foundries who work with a yearly licensing model, because their control over the server allows them to shut down access if the license is not renewed. The advantage for web designers is that the code needed to use the font is often a bit shorter and a matter of simple copy and paste. Still, from the user‚Äôs point of view, the self-hosted model is much more attractive. Not being dependent on a third-party host means the website will keep working even if the type-hosting service shuts down.</p>
<p>What licenses generally don‚Äôt allow you to do is open the files in a font editor and change the typeface. I personally feel that‚Äôs a bit of hubris on the type designer‚Äôs part. In order to achieve your design goals, you might well need to change the typeface. What is great about type is that it is a work of art and a graphical tool at the same time. Luckily, I‚Äôve never heard of a designer getting in trouble for altering a typeface.</p>
<h2>Free and Open Source</h2>
<p>The delayed response of traditional type foundries to the arrival of web fonts also paved the way for the emergence of Open Source typefaces. While traditional type foundries stressed that their licenses did not permit use on the web, typefaces that had been distributed with more permissive Open Source licenses could be put online freely.</p>
<p>The first Open Source typefaces came about even before Linux and Open Source were invented. Donald Knuth‚Äôs typesetting program LaTeX and the associated parametric font Computer Modern were put into the public domain by their author. Bitstream donated Matthew Carter‚Äôs Charter to the X.Org Foundation (X Window System pre-2004) in 1992. Charter is a slab serif typeface that was designed for early laser printers. Its distinguishing feature is that it manages to create the visual complexity of a serif typeface with simple, stark, memory-efficient curves. The Free and Open Source typeface in which this book is set, Charis SIL, is based on Charter.</p>
<p>While initially the process of putting a font online was technologically involved, websites like Font Squirrel soon appeared on the scene to made the process easy. All you have to do is upload an open typeface and out will come web fonts. Usage really took off when Google introduced Google Fonts. To woo designers still using PDF and Flash, which are less searchable than regular webpages, Google wanted to make the web platform more graphically attractive. Providing web fonts for free was the way to do it. Luckily, the person they hired to oversee this operation, Dave Crossland, was an advocate for open fonts. So, all the typefaces on Google Fonts did not just end up free in the monetary sense but also free to modify and build upon. Design-wise, the Google Fonts are a mixed bag some are quite good, some are very bad. But Google made it very easy to embed these fonts onto a website, which ensured the project‚Äôs success. What holds for commercial foundries, holds for Google Fonts as well: If you find a font you like, it‚Äôs best to download it and host it yourself, if only to deny Google the click statistics. Furthermore, by seeking out the typeface‚Äôs webpage, you find out about the designer. They might offer ways of sending donations or participating in the crowdfunding of their new project. Or you might want to commission them to add new characters, styles and weights.</p>
