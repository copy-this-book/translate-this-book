<h1>This Coin Has Two Sides: Suing and Getting Sued</h1>
<p>At least you won‚Äôt go to jail. Copyright disputes tend to occur between civil parties‚Äîartists sue; artists get sued; artists sue other artists. You won‚Äôt go to jail, but finding yourself in a lawsuit can be an expensive and risky affair.</p>
<p>On a pragmatic level, it‚Äôs probably best to avoid them altogether. Then again, our real knowledge of the law comes from court decisions, this is where all these treaties, decrees and laws are interpreted and applied. Each judgment in your favour can matter for other artists as well.</p>
<h2>You don‚Äôt need to sue</h2>
<p>When your copyright is infringed upon, you don‚Äôt have to take action if you don‚Äôt want to. Publishing reproductions of your work on your website or social media channels may lead to them being picked up and recirculated by bloggers. Unless you specifically state the images are free to redistribute, this is a copyright infringement. Of course, you can let it slide as long as it doesn‚Äôt bother you. And also feel free to prohibit only those redistributions that, for whatever reason, don‚Äôt sit right with you.</p>
<p>With other forms of intellectual property, you cannot discriminate: if you want to uphold a trademark, you must be consistent in taking action when others use it or its protection might lapse. In this chapter we focus on copyright because this is the most common subject of the legal proceedings in which artists and designers find themselves.</p>
<p>If you want to prohibit someone who has copied your work from doing so, most of the time you don‚Äôt need to sue. First, ask yourself what you want to accomplish. Theoretically, you can achieve the desired outcome by asking the infringer directly. If your copyright has been infringed upon, here are some things you could demand were the infringement proven in court:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop the reproduction: The other party must cease distribution of the offending reproduction. That means taking it offline and, in the case of a physical item, destroying any remaining stock.</li>
<li>Adapt the reproduction to respect your moral rights: If the other party has infringed on your moral rights, by not giving you proper credit or modifying your work in a way that doesn‚Äôt correspond to your artistic vision, you can ask them to adapt subsequent editions.</li>
<li>Pay for the work: If the other party did not pay for your work, you can still ask them to do so after the fact.</li>
<li>Pay damages: Because the other party did not follow the legitimate route of asking permission before reusing your work, you can ask for damages. You can ask additional damages for infringement on your moral rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Heavy stuff. If you believe the infringing artist acted in good faith, you might not want to release the full arsenal. Especially when it comes to the web, a malleable space where intellectual property rights are not rigorously enforced, it could suffice to ask them to remove the material in question, or to properly credit or link back to you.</p>
<p>An illegitimate reproduction is also a business opportunity, which is why sending an invoice is also an option to consider. If you‚Äôre courteous but firm and show you understand copyright law, the infringer will understand you know your rights and that it‚Äôs in their interest to reach an amicable solution. Personally, I think asking for remuneration is a more elegant solution than having the offending work taken offline or destroyed.</p>
<p>Since there is no fair use in the EU (see chapter 5.1, <em>In Love with the Copy: Visual Arts</em>), you are well within your rights to send an invoice even when the copiers are amateur bloggers, poor artists or activists and aren‚Äôt making a cent off your work. In terms of karma, however, it perhaps makes more sense only to invoice when the other party is generating income from your work.</p>
<p>If your complaints fall on deaf ears, this is when you can sue. Or not. A lawsuit remains risky and expensive. Your alternatives are either to abandon the pursuit, which would be sad, or to try the court of public opinion. Especially when dealing with a large company, who can be presumed to have big budgets for legal expenses but who are sensitive to public opinion, your time might be well spent trying to generate a buzz on social media. Theirs wouldn‚Äôt be the first legal department to get an anxious call from PR.</p>
<p>While the legal system tilts in favour of large companies who can afford long trials, it is still possible that a small firm wins a trial against a major corporation. Modern Dog, a graphic design studio from Seattle, won a copyright case against Disney, who had reproduced the former‚Äôs drawing (of a dog!) on a t-shirt. Unfortunately, in order to get there, Modern Dog had to sell off the building that housed their studio‚Ä¶<sup>üìÉ Amy Marturana, <em>Modern Dog Design Company Sells Studio To Fund Copyright Infringement Lawsuit</em>.</sup></p>
<h2>Getting sued</h2>
<p>Since, just like you, the other party usually has an interest in avoiding time-consuming and expensive lawsuits, it‚Äôs quite rare to find yourself in the middle of one. Before there‚Äôs a lawsuit, there is usually a letter or email accusing you of copyright infringement, the cease-and-desist letter. Just as when it‚Äôs your work being infringed upon, this letter can range from a plain request to remove an image to a hefty bill.</p>
<p>If this happens, the first question to ask yourself: Are they right? This book gives you the tools to provide a tentative response to that question. If you did infringe upon a third parties‚Äô copyright, there is little to do but play along. Depending on how the letter or email is formulated, you might still have some margin to avoid paying up.</p>
<p>If you think they‚Äôre wrong, seek a lawyer. They will be able to tell if you‚Äôve made the right assessment and give advice on how to proceed. They will also be able to inform you of the costs and logistics of the legal process. They will help you respond to the cease-and-desist letter. If the other persists, this is one moment in your life when you can seriously say the words: ‚ÄúWell, sue me!‚Äù First ask your lawyer, though.</p>

<p>If this book seeks to help remove some of the law‚Äôs aura of impenetrability, there is still no way to replace legal professionals, especially once you are in the vicinity of lawsuits. The opportunity to collaborate with these artisans of the law will undoubtedly bring new perspectives but unfortunately they don‚Äôt come cheap.</p>
<p>This is where artists‚Äô rights organisations shine, when it comes to dealing with people infringing on an author‚Äôs copyright. If your work is represented by such an organisation, it suffices to indicate the infringing use and they‚Äôll take it from there. They try to avoid lawsuits but are able to represent you in court if it comes to that. These organisations can‚Äôt really help when it‚Äôs you on the receiving end of the lawsuit, however. In fact, they may be the ones suing you!</p>
<p>If you are part of a trade organisation or union, they might have a legal service. Members of BNO, the Association of Dutch Designers, can contact a legal help-desk for free and for a relatively low fee can engage the foundation for legal aid to designers to address legal procedures on their behalf. Not every trade organisation has such a well-developed legal arm but, at the very least, the network of fellow members are able to share experiences and recommend lawyers.</p>
<p>If you have legal expenses insurance (also called ‚Äúgeneral liability‚Äù), now is as good a moment as any to read the fine print. Does it cover copyright infringement? If so, in which way and to what extent? A caveat is that general liability insurance might rule out any behaviour that can be considered reckless and will only cover accidental copyright infringement, where it can be reasonably assumed you did not know you were infringing. If you do involve insurance providers, they will probably seek out the required professionals for you.</p>
<p>Finally, if none of these cases apply and it is up to you alone to seek out counsel, the easiest way is to contact your local bar (that‚Äôs the association of lawyers, not the place selling drinks) and ask them to recommend a lawyer who specialises in intellectual property. In addition, the bar should inform you of any possibilities for those on lower incomes to access government-subsidised legal counsel.</p>
