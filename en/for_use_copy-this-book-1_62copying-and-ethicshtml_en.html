<h1>Some Copies are Better than Others: Copying and Ethics</h1>
<p>There is a schema of copyright critique that points to the fundamental role copying has in art history, shows that copyright gets it wrong when it comes to how creativity works and thereby claims copyright to be useless.</p>
<p>A closer look would have shown, that while copying is indeed a basis of any form of cultural exchange, artists have consistently tried to promote some forms of copying over others. The policing of which forms of copying are acceptable and which aren‚Äôt is done in part by critics and artists themselves (the court of public opinion) and in part by the legal system. These two don‚Äôt overlap completely. There are forms of copying that are legally permitted but frowned upon by artists and vice versa.</p>
<h2>Synonyms for copying</h2>
<p>Many of the words used for copying carry with them a moral judgment. Within the western romantic framework, recognition of the copy as part of artistic practice exists hand in hand with the ongoing desire for originality in authorship. In this sense, ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù denotes a form of copying that is morally acceptable because the sources have been sufficiently perfused. An ‚Äúimitation,‚Äù a ‚Äúrip-off‚Äù or a work that is ‚Äúderivative‚Äù are forms of copying that are considered to not be original enough. An ‚Äúhomage‚Äù is also an unoriginal copy, but it gets a pass because the unoriginality is assumed by its author as intrinsic to the work.</p>
<p>Some words change their meaning over time. In the 1980s and 1990s, ‚Äúappropriation‚Äù was regarded as a valid and potentially subversive form of copying; in the 2000s, especially in the United States, ‚Äúcultural appropriation‚Äù has come to signify an abusive form of copying, where an artist uses elements of a minority culture disrespectfully.</p>
<p>Some words have always had a double meaning. ‚ÄúPiracy‚Äù was first used to describe the activities, legal at the time, of US publishers who republished British authors in the US without paying royalties to the authors or their original publishers. Decried as dishonest by the authors in question, the US publishers were quick to seize on the imagery provided by the term and portray themselves as naval Robin Hoods, roaming the seas for riches they could distribute to the poor.<sup>üìö Robert E. Spoo, <em>Without Copyrights: Piracy, Publishing, and the Public Domain</em>.</sup></p>
<p>A similar scenario played out in the 2000s when illegal file-sharing websites like The Pirate Bay embraced the pirate moniker. Even if some, like Free software activist Richard Stallman, objected to the use of the word piracy (for copying digital content without a company‚Äôs consent is nothing compared to killing people and stealing their gold<sup>üìÉ Richard Stallman, <em>Ending the War on Sharing</em>.</sup>), the strategy worked well. In their fight against file-sharing, the entertainment industry had the misfortune of the 2000s marking a renaissance of the pirate in popular culture, most visibly in Johnny Depp‚Äôs role as Captain Jack Sparrow in <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> (2003-17). File-sharing became associated in part with adventure and non‚Äëconformism.</p>

<p>The word ‚Äúappropriation,‚Äù in the context of culture, can be empowering. After all, to appropriate is to make something one‚Äôs own. The basic mechanism of appropriation as an artistic strategy is the use of existing images in a new context to challenge the meaning of the original.</p>
<p>Staying with the game of synonyms, an appropriation might essentially be the same thing as ‚Äúripping-off,‚Äù except a recontextualisation invites the potential of a critical or subversive effect.</p>
<p>Appropriation art started to appear in the 1980s, following on from pop art‚Äôs tendency to incorporate images from everyday life and popular culture. While some appropriation art focused on the imagery of mass media, like Richard Prince‚Äôs exploration of the Marlboro man, a lot of the ongoing appeal of appropriation art lies with artists who deal with feminist and post-colonial themes. In <em>Dream Girls</em> (1989‚Äì90), Deborah Bright inserts her butch persona into production stills of romantic Hollywood classics<sup>üìö Catherine Lord and Richard Meyer, <em>Art &amp; Queer Culture</em>.</sup> (‚Äúbutch‚Äù is a term used by lesbians embracing and playing with gender representations typically identified as masculine). In <em>Ulugali‚Äôi Samoa ‚Äì</em> <em>Samoan Couple</em> (2005), Shigeyuki Kihara constructs a photograph in which she embodies both members of a straight couple, while appropriating the visual codes of nineteenth-century colonialist photography. She draws attention to the way in which colonial photographers impose western gender norms as universal and assumes her own status as a member of the Samoan third gender, which would have been impossible at the time.<sup>üìö Ibid.</sup></p>
<p>The appropriation of existing visual images is regarded as a valid strategy in visual art but legally speaking it is much more complicated. The US statute of fair use gives more leeway to US artists than their European counterparts, nevertheless many examples of appropriation art have necessitated thoroughly-negotiated licensing deals. There is a large difference between what the community of visual artists thinks ought to be possible and what is actually possible legally. Chapter 5.1, <em>In Love with the Copy: Visual Arts</em>, goes into all of this in full detail.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs no coincidence, then, that one of the more famous examples of appropriation art uses works in the public domain as its basis. Sherrie Levine‚Äôs series <em>After Walker Evans</em> (1981) reproduces some of Evans‚Äô well-known portraits of rural poverty. The reason Levine was able to make the series without much legal trouble is that Evans created the photographs while working for the Farm Security Administration. As we can see in chapter 6.1, <em>No Known Restrictions: Public Domain</em>, in the US the work of federal employees becomes public domain by default. The fact Levine couldn‚Äôt have chosen just any photographer she wanted as the starting point for her series shows the extent to which artistic creation is shaped by legal considerations.</p>
<h2>Cultural appropriation</h2>
<p>In recent years the connotations of appropriation have become negative with the prevalence of the notion of cultural appropriation, especially in the United States. If appropriation means to take something that is not yours in order to subvert it, the original, more or less positive understanding of appropriation art only made sense because artists were assumed to be taking a stand against something larger and more powerful than themselves‚Äîcapitalism, colonialism, patriarchy. What the concept of cultural appropriation emphasises is that artists also occupy positions of power for which they should be held accountable.</p>
<p>Cultural appropriation is when an artist or cultural producer in a privileged position (commonly white, straight, male, middle class, able-bodied and particularly these in combinations) copies works or motifs from persons in a less privileged position. Sanam, the Instagram influencer most famous for her collaboration on Rihanna‚Äôs video <em>Bitch Better Have My Money</em> (2015), gives the most accessible explanation I‚Äôve seen to date:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs really strange growing up and being told that your culture is ugly, being so ashamed of it, and then, for a fleeting moment, feeling sort of excited and proud when it starts to become a fashion statement by your oppressors. But then you very quickly realise that it‚Äôs actually incredibly fucking insulting.<sup>üìÉ Sameer Rao, <em>Sanam: Cultural Appropriation Is ‚ÄòActually Incredibly F***ing Insulting‚Äô</em>.</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interview between two fashion designers, C√©line Semaan and Marine Serre, makes clear what‚Äôs at stake. Serre‚Äôs work seems to draw heavily from the iconography and dress associated with the Islamic faith, namely, the crescent moon and the hijab. Serre prefers not to be explicit about what her intentions are with this appropriation: ‚ÄúThere are people who think the print is quite radical and there are others who don‚Äôt know anything about politics and think it‚Äôs just cute. And this is exactly what I love.‚Äù Semaan points out that such a statement comes from a position of privilege. Muslim women face prejudice and can get into trouble both for wearing hijab and for not wearing one. She says, ‚Äúit was shocking to me that the main image that was circulating from your show was one of a white woman who has the privilege to choose whether or not she wants to wear the hijab.‚Äù What‚Äôs unsettling, then, is that the designer uses these religious symbols to create attention and audience but chooses not to address any of the social or political issues with which these symbols are entangled. Semaan: ‚ÄúYou have a privilege, you have a platform. How do you use your platform and your privilege to give a voice to minorities, to actually create a positive change?‚Äù<sup>üìÉ C√©line Semaan, <em>A Fashion Designer and an Activist Talk Cultural Appropriation</em></sup>.</p>
<p>When it comes to cultural appropriation, copyright law hardly gets involved. This is because copyright only applies to individual artistic expressions. A style, a flow, a motive, an accent cannot be copyrighted. Plus it is easy enough to find images of non-western cultures that are in the public domain. A culture has no legal personhood; a culture cannot sue. And even if it could, it is not clear who could represent it because a culture is rarely clearly delineated.</p>
<h2>Plagiarism</h2>
<p>Plagiarism is to pass off the work of someone else as your own. In that way, it‚Äôs a synonym for copying with a more negative connotation.</p>
<p>Straightforward cases of plagiarism are also copyright infringements. Taking an article someone else wrote and publishing it under your own name infringes upon both their copyright (because you copied it without their permission) and their moral rights (because you failed to acknowledge their authorship). While the prototypical kind of plagiarism is textual, it works in other media as well; it is plagiarism any time you take a drawing, photo or piece of software code and pass it off as your own.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs interesting to look at the differences between appropriation and plagiarism. From a legal standpoint, it‚Äôs hard to tell the difference. An appropriation, in the empowering sense, acknowledges the copying, whereas plagiarism hides it. But an artist who appropriates might not explicitly credit the appropriated image, leaving it up to the public to recognise the appropriation as such. Someone called out as a plagiarist may very well defend their work as an appropriation. This is exactly what happened in a discussion between the artists Shepard Fairey and Mark Vallen: Vallen sought out many of the posters copied by Fairey and pointed out that the references were often too obscure<sup>üìÉ Mark Vallen, <em>Obey Plagiarist Shepard Fairey</em>.</sup> for the public to recognise the appropriation as such,<sup>üìö Shepard Fairey, <em>Obey: Supply &amp; Demand‚ÄØ: The Art of Shepard Fairey</em>.</sup></p>
<p>What‚Äôs interesting in this case, is that the discussion about the difference between appropriation and plagiarism happens alongside a discussion that is closer to the question of cultural appropriation: Fairey‚Äôs source-images come in large part from radically left-wing activism, whereas his copies tend to erase this ideological context and replace it with a reference to his Obey brand. I imagine Vallen wouldn‚Äôt have judged Fairey‚Äôs decision to reuse existing images so harshly if his source-images were 1950s advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>If we look at the definitions of plagiarism as defined by academic institutions, they tend to have a scope which is quite broad, broader than that of copyright. Yale University, for example, uses a definition where plagiarism is the ‚Äúuse of another‚Äôs work, words or ideas without attribution.‚Äù Whereas, within copyright, it‚Äôs perfectly possible to use another work without giving attribution. If you don‚Äôt literally copy a work but are inspired by it and reuse its style, for example, there is no requirement of attribution. Neither does copyright protect ideas or require attribution for them. Ideas are not considered to belong to one person.</p>
<p>The requirements for an academic text, then, are much tighter than for a blog post or a newspaper column. If, with Roland Barthes, ‚Äúthe text is a tissue of citations, resulting from the thousand sources of culture,‚Äù<sup>üìÉ Roland Barthes, <em>The Death of the Author</em>.</sup> academic writing aims to lay bare the stitches, making sure every statement is attached to a source.</p>
<p>The question is, should artists or designers hold themselves to a similar standard? In the fast world of art and design, fashions and trends submerge and resurface and you live under the constant ‚Äúecstasy of influence.‚Äù<sup>üìÉ Jonathan Lethem, <em>The Ecstasy of Influence</em>.</sup> While the effort is commendable, it would be difficult to always accurately map and share the pedigree of your work. In an educational setting, it seems more realistic that you provide a bibliography of your work, so to speak, in order to show its references, motives and sources.</p>
<h2>To copy today</h2>
<p>If there ever existed a time when artists and designers could copy freely, that time isn‚Äôt now. It‚Äôs not just that many of the favoured tools at artists‚Äô disposal, like sampling, remix, collage or appropriation, are not quite compatible with copyright. It‚Äôs also that the copying faces the scrutiny of your peers, who probably do not dismiss artistic reuse as such but who might get picky over the details. Vallen calls out Fairey and Semaan calls out Serre not because they copy but because of the way they do it.</p>
<p>There are several reasons that, unlike legal restrictions on artistic creation, discussions around plagiarism and cultural appropriation are a great thing for creatives around the world. Firstly, these discussions make clear the game is no longer played by one set of rules because there‚Äôs not one group who gets to set them. As art and design make new connections to activism and technology, new conceptions of art arise and people who might not have had a voice before are heard.</p>
<p>Secondly, as an artist or designer, being open about your influences and references helps to put in perspective the ideology upon which copyright is built. If copyright forbids many of the strategies upon which you‚Äôve come to rely, it‚Äôs only because it is based upon an unrealistic view of creativity, where one creates in splendid isolation. If you can help others to have a more grounded and realistic idea about what it is to create and copy, then that is a great way to help the discussions about copyright move forward.</p>
