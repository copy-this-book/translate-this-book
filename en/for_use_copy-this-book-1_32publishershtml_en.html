<h1>Mutual Dependency: Publishers</h1>
<p>There is a gap in between the author and the public. Book publishers, record labels and art galleries work to bridge that gap. Their role has changed with the internet but remains quintessential. As an artist, you might feel some ambivalence towards these players. On the one hand, you need them. On the other, they always take a cut. You might wonder: Am I getting a good deal?</p>
<p>Copyright is intrinsic to these relations. As the copyright for anything you make belongs to you by default, most contracts between artists and publishers consist of an artist licensing their copyright to a publisher. This is the legal basis by which a publisher can exploit an artist‚Äôs work, that is, sell copies of it. Contracts differ in terms of how much copyright you license and how much control you retain over your work into the future.</p>
<p>There are two possible deals you can have with a publisher. The first is a traditional deal, whereby you assign copyright to your publisher. The second is a distribution deal, where you retain copyright but license the publisher to distribute copies. To learn more about the difference between copyright assignment and copyright licensing, see chapter 3.3, <em>Setting the Conditions of Copying: Licenses</em>.</p>
<p>Publishers bring the following to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capital to invest in the production and promotion of your work. They pay the bills. Your financial risk is reduced to the time spent making the work. Publishers mitigate your risk by offering an advance. If your work is not a commercial success, it is the publisher who loses money.</li>
<li>Connection to professionals from other disciplines during the development of the work (e.g.¬†editors, music producers), its post-production (e.g.¬†designers, copy editors) and its marketing phases.</li>
<li>Cultivated network of contacts with media outlets and journalists in order to garner attention for the work, notably from mainstream media.</li>
<li>Ongoing investment in the circulation of physical goods such as printed books or records within a distribution network, as well as the management of any related inventories.</li>
<li>Quality guarantee. People generally rely on others to discover new work and when there is a lot of choice audiences are often happy to rely on the choices of major publishers, especially in popular genres. A publisher therefore serves as a curator and taste-maker.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you‚Äôre thinking of self-publishing, take the time to see how you can cover these different aspects.</p>
<h2>Is a gallery a publisher?</h2>
<p>Art galleries are publishers in the sense that they help you reach a public. A good gallery brings all the advantages listed above. They help finance your work, find the right people to work with, cultivate press and media attention and introduce your work to their habitual clients‚Äîa public of art-buyers that you probably would not encounter otherwise.</p>
<p>The difference is that none of this is based on copyright. As is mentioned in chapter 3.1, <em>No Easy Love Affair: Copyright and Money</em>, the way that galleries certify copies as authentic is by way of a system that exists in parallel to copyright. In fact, many artists don‚Äôt have any kind of formal agreement with their gallery.</p>
<p>In the absence of a written agreement, copyright still belongs entirely to the artist. This means that the gallery can‚Äôt make new editions of your work nor license it without your approval.</p>
<h2>Copyright assignment deal</h2>
<p>In a traditional publishing deal, you assign copyright to a publisher. From this point on, the publisher directs the process. They propose collaborators and devise the marketing campaign. They pay all the costs. When the product sells, you start to receive royalties. Royalties are a predetermined amount per product. The royalty can be quite low as the publisher needs to earn back their investment and still make a profit.</p>
<p>Within such an agreement, you can expect to receive an ‚Äúadvance.‚Äù The name comes from the fact that royalties only start coming in once the book or record is distributed and sold and you get an advance before this happens. Once royalties outweigh the advance, you‚Äôll also receive the royalties. If the work does not sell well enough to cover the advance, you still get to keep the advance.</p>
<p>There are a few points to take into account when negotiating a deal in which you sign over copyright. Record labels and book publishers might take on certain costs, such as those of recording or distributing, and then deduct them from your royalties. That‚Äôs not exactly fair, since you assign copyright to the publisher in the expectation that they invest in your work. If you end up paying for these investments yourself, with the publisher keeping the copyright, you have a raw deal. As Courtney Love famously said: ‚ÄúWorst of all, after all this, the band owns none of its work‚Ä¶ they can pay the mortgage forever but they‚Äôll never own the house.‚Äù<sup>üìÉ Courtney Love, <em>Courtney Love Does the¬†Math</em>.</sup></p>
<p>When the publisher owns copyright, they can make money with it in various ways beyond selling copies of the work. The publisher can sell the translation rights and movie rights to your book or license your music to be used in movies. Your contract needs to specify that you, the creator, receive a share of the profit for such licensing arrangements. It should also make clear you receive a cut if the publisher sells the work for a yet-to-be-invented medium.</p>
<p>Finally, your contract should stipulate what happens when your publication is no longer available. This is important because it can happen that a publisher no longer sees any commercial interest in keeping your work on the market. If this occurs, since you don‚Äôt own copyright, you cannot distribute it yourself! In 2015, the Dutch legislation on contracts involving copyright was amended. If copyright is assigned to a publisher, you now have the right to dissolve the contract if the publisher fails to exploit the work adequately, even if the contract in question does not explicitly mention this possibility.</p>
<h2>Distribution deal</h2>
<p>In a distribution deal, you retain the copyright of your work. You produce the work yourself and are responsible for finding collaborators. The publisher‚Äôs role is to disseminate the work. In exchange, they get a percentage of the revenue for each item sold.</p>
<p>The publisher is responsible for distribution. In other words, getting the product out there. They use their network to place the work in retailers and attract the attention of reviewers and commentators. You profit from the brand-recognition and reputation of the publisher. Promotion will likely be a shared job. You and the publisher are both incentivised to promote the work, since you share the profit.</p>
<p>The upsides to a distribution deal are evident: the artist has more control and takes a larger cut of the money made. The major downside of a distribution deal is clear as well: it is riskier. You take on part of the financial risk usually assigned to the publisher. It is very possible the money invested to produce the work is never earned back. In that case, you might find yourself with a bruised ego, an empty bank account and boxes of unsold works!</p>
<h2>Self-publishing</h2>
<p>Without the help of a publisher, it might be hard to reach a large audience. Publishers are gatekeepers; they not only have to find your work commercially-viable, it also has to suit their taste. Historically, many groundbreaking texts have been self-published because their authors could not find a publisher. Laurence Sterne borrowed money from a friend to print the first edition of <em>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy</em> (1759). Walt Whitman self-published the first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1855), helping out with the typesetting. Of course, if such works achieve notoriety, a more traditional publisher will often swoop in to bring the work to an even larger audience. Sometimes it‚Äôs the self-publishing project itself that grows in scale. Virginia Woolf‚Äôs publishing house <em>Hogart Press</em> (1917‚Äì) started with a small press in her living room, but grew to be a sizeable company publishing not only Woolf‚Äôs most well known novels and essays, but those of contemporary writers and thinkers as well.<sup>üìö Craig Dworkin, Simon Morris and Nick Thurston, <em>Do or DIY</em>.</sup></p>
<p>The financial risk of self-publishing is lower than it is in the case of a distribution deal as it is possible to work in much smaller editions and with simpler means. There are large upfront costs to offset the printing of a book or the pressing of a CD or a record. A self-published edition could use simpler means like digital printing, photocopying and CD-Rs. Today‚Äôs graphic designers have rediscovered risography and some musicians are even releasing to cassette. And, of course, there‚Äôs the most accessible and successful of all self-publishing mediums to date: the internet.</p>
<p>Publishing through a website or blog is extremely cheap. In the interest of keeping control over your work, you can get your own domain and install free and open source software like WordPress. You might think twice before putting your work on sites like Medium or Blogspot because these could change and be gone at any moment. The content of your blog is freely accessible. For content you want to monetise, like ebooks and sound files, you need to find a technical solution to handle payments and file-delivery. You could use sites like Paddle or FastSpring, which enable files to be sold directly via links embedded on your website. This way you receive the largest possible cut and your public receives files they can use on any computer system. Companies like Apple, Google and Amazon all have their own stores, which are extremely accessible from the devices they sell although it does mean files are limited to these devices. I spoke with a publisher who told me that, in addition to selling via their own website, ebooks need to be available on all these companies‚Äô stores because part of the public doesn‚Äôt look anywhere else.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre self-publishing physical media, distribution is a huge challenge. The movie <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em> (2013) has the protagonist shuffling through New York with a crate of his records. When he crashes at a fellow musician‚Äôs place, he discovers a similar box underneath a side table. So, how to get your work into shops? You might have to visit and persuade shop-owners one by one. Even if you decide to only take orders through the internet, fulfilling them can take a lot of time. When Beno√Æt Jacques‚Äô self-published children‚Äôs book <em>La nuit du visiteur</em> (2008) was a big success at the children‚Äôs book fair of Montreuil, winning the coveted Baobab award, Jacques spent most of the following year at the local post office.<sup>Beno√Æt Jacques, presentation at the opening of the exhibition <em>D√©lire de Livres</em>, BibioXL, Ixelles (February 20, 2014).</sup>
Promotion depends on how mainstream your project is. The more specific your subject-matter is, the easier it is to find an audience by yourself. Plus the internet helps. Reaching out to the right bloggers and posting on the right forums costs time only and this will reach your intended public with a precision that no newspaper ad could ever hope for. In fact, you should do this kind of targeted promotion even if you have a traditional publisher. After all, who knows your particular subculture better than you?</p>
