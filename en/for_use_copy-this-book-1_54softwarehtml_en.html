<h1>For Humans and Computers to Read: Software</h1>
<p>Do you write code? In that case you write in a language readable to both machines and humans, which is what makes software unique as a cultural object. Software is made up of lines of code that turn into a program that runs on a computer and which can also be changed and amended.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you work in media arts or graphic design chances are you write code yourself. Code can be written to interface with an existing program or you can make your own program from existing code. In any case, rare today is an artist who does not use any computer software at all. And since code is now seen as a creative, cultural expression it receives the protection of copyright. That means, having become best friends with your laptop, you‚Äôve invited all the complexities of copyright into your life.</p>
<h2>How software got copyright</h2>
<p>Because software is a product of technological innovation, as with photography in the nineteenth century, it took a while for it to be recognised as a creative expression befitting copyright protection. Initially, code was regarded as a technological tool whose form was wholly determined by its function. But judges changed their minds when they started considering the source-code of software. Source-code consists of lines of programming code, written by programmers, that are turned into 0s and 1s before the program can run on a computer. Writing computer code has a lot more limitations than writing a text in natural language for there are sequences of computer code that are simply wrong, in the sense that the computer refuses to execute them. That being said, as a programmer you have space to make a lot of creative decisions in the course of writing a computer program. That is why courts have decided to treat computer programs in the same way they do literary texts, which means computer programs have similarly strong copyright protection.</p>
<p>This form of copyright protection gives software producers legal leverage against users copying their software without permission. It also protects against competitors taking parts of the code for their own products. What it does not protect against is competitors imitating the product through implementing their own code. With code it is possible to create a software program with the same functionality as another one, while using a completely different set of codes.</p>
<h2>The medium of software</h2>
<p>The form in which software is operated and transmitted has changed considerably throughout the history of computing. The first computers were hugely expensive. They were used by multiple people. Systems were developed for remote terminals, combinations of input and output devices would connect users to the mainframe. The operating software was developed by the companies selling the computers and in research institutions. The software running on the computers was often developed in-house.</p>
<p>The development of the personal computer changed the configuration. Instead of running the programs from a mainframe accessed remotely, all programs as well as documents created were stored on the computer itself. It is for this mode of computing that programs such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop and Cubase were developed. These programs were distributed on floppy disks, CDs and later also through the internet. It is for this model that copyright became quite important as software took on the role of cultural commodity to be bought and sold just like a music album.</p>
<p>Since then, the internet allows personal computers to connect to other computers. While in its early incarnation the world wide web was primarily a medium for the exchange of information, advances in web technology have made it possible to run applications through a web browser. One of the earliest web applications to achieve mainstream popularity was Gmail. Many paid applications now run online as well. In this model, copyright takes the back seat as, after all, the user does not own a copy of the software, it runs on the server of the company. The way companies deal with users is through contracts. Because they control access, once you stop paying they can simply shut you out.</p>
<h2>Licenses</h2>
<p>In copyright law, buying a book only makes you the owner of the physical artefact, not of the text contained therein. As a reader, you are not immediately confronted with this fact because most of the actions you would want to perform with the book (reading, lending) do not infringe on copyright. Copying a physical book is not straightforward. This is why, initially, copyright litigation existed mainly between publishers. Copying computer files, however, is trivial. Having bought a program, you can easily pass around the file. A company can buy one copy of a program and install it on 2000 computers. This is why software authors will do their best to enforce copyright immediately. This is also an explanation for why copyright evolved into something of a hot topic among the computer-savvy in the home computing era. A casual reader of physical books might not run into the limitations of copyright but in the digital world users are directly confronted with them whether because the computer program has a form of copyright protection installed or because when purchasing it one has had to decide on the specifics of the license (single-user or multi-user, limited in time or perpetual). Of course, now that a lot of media-consumption has shifted from physical carriers to digital downloads and streaming services, a larger public will start to be confronted with these issues.</p>
<p>In copyright terms, software licenses are non-exclusive licenses granted from the software author to the software user. They give the user the right to install and use the software, often on a limited number of computers. Companies can negotiate for a license that allows for more computers and/or users. These licenses used to be granted perpetually. This means that buying a software once for an upfront sum included the right to use it forever.</p>
<p>In practice, it is rare to use a certain version of a software for longer than a few years. Companies continuously release upgrades. Such upgrades might contain useful features. In what sometimes amounts to planned obsolescence, companies also regularly change the file format of their program in newer versions so that once many people start using it and exchanging files, users of the old version are forced to upgrade. Finally, software is developed to run on a specific version of an operating system. When users upgrade their operating system it might also be necessary to buy new software.</p>
<p>Software authors are now switching to licenses that are limited in time. Most famously, Adobe now sells their Creative Cloud software (formerly Creative Suite) through a monthly subscription. This has some direct benefits for costumers. Licensing costs get spread out over time and are predictable. Yet the downsides are clear as well. The biggest one is that most software produces files that are only readable with the same software. So, if you decide to stop paying the subscription fee you cannot open your files anymore. The software company effectively holds your files hostage. This problem is only going to become more pressing since a lot of software authors are moving away from file systems and migrating the content to cloud-hosted databases. Instead of being left with files they are no longer able to open, users might be left with no files at all when their subscription runs out. More than ever, software users need an exit strategy.</p>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>Some of the most persistent and sophisticated critique of copyright originated in the computer programming community. This might have something to do with the dual nature of software, a software program is both a useful tool and a creative work. Because software is a tool, it makes sense you want to adapt it to your unique situation, especially if you know something about computer programming. As Stephen Fry says in a short film written and directed by Matt Lee: ‚ÄúIf you have plumbing in your house it may be that you don‚Äôt understand it, but you may have a friend who does and they may suggest that you move a pipe here a stopcock there, or a valve somewhere else.‚Äù<sup>üì∫ Stephen Fry and Matt Lee, <em>Happy Birthday to GNU</em>.</sup> And because software is a cultural object that embodies the intentions and design decisions of its author, you might want to exchange your modifications with the original author and discuss them.</p>
<p>Software‚Äôs malleable nature has made it possible for communities to form where promiscuous exchange and collaboration around computer software is the norm, as in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Homebrew Computer Club. What these communities have in common is that software is seen as a cultural good to be exchanged not a commodity to be sold. Software developer Eric Stephen Raymond has analysed that the underlying mechanism in such communities resembles that of a gift economy.<sup>üìÉ Eric Stephen Raymond, <em>The Hacker Milieu as Gift Culture</em>.</sup> What happens time and time again within such communities, though, is that some participants start to understand the economic worth their software represents outside of the community so they begin shielding off their software with copyright and bring it to the market. This can create such tensions in the community that it does not necessarily survive.<sup>üìö Steven Levy, <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em>. The book describes a number of such pivotal moments at the Homebrew Computer Club in the late 1970s, when what was a forum for exchange started to inspire its members to launch companies.</sup></p>
<p>Free Software is a movement that originated from just such a rupture. The software developer Richard Stallman, working at CSAIL, was hugely frustrated by software in his lab becoming encumbered with copyright protection and his colleagues joining venture capital-backed software companies. In the name of his belief that all software be free to open up and modify, he and his collaborators set out to create free versions of commonly used tools. He called this the GNU project and the underlying movement the Free Software movement. The Free Software movement proved to have a lasting influence on software, and possibly upon culture in general, because it created a series of copyright licenses for the software that set out to open up, rather than restrict, the usage of the software code (see chapter 3.3, <em>Setting the Conditions of Copying: Licenses</em>).</p>
<p>It is quite probable you are already using Free Software. Much of the infrastructure for the world wide web runs on the Linux operating system, as do Android smartphones. Many of the codes upon which web designers build are Free Software or, as it‚Äôs now popularly known, Open Source.<sup>While all Free Software is also Open Source software, not all Open Source software falls under Stallman‚Äôs definition of Free Software. See the chapter: <em>5.2. Setting the Conditions of Copying: Licenses</em>.</sup> If you‚Äôre a media artist, you might use Processing or openFrameworks to build interactive installations. For ‚Äúwhat you see is what you get‚Äù (WYSIWYG) content creation, Free Software is less popular. Adobe‚Äôs dominant position is primarily under threat from other proprietary software such as Bohemian Coding‚Äôs Sketch. But tools like Inkscape, GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), Scribus and new experimental publishing tools based on web technologies like html2print and Paged.js (all used in the preparation of this book!) do exist. Working with Free Software has all the advantages and all the challenges of working with community-owned initiatives. You might need to put in some time upfront for configuring and learning but once you have acquired a rapport with a tool and its community no company can come in and take that away. On the flipside, a commercial software product is one takeover away from being abandoned. When Apple bought Logic they discontinued the PC version, when Adobe acquired FreeHand they discontinued it altogether.</p>
<p>Free Software is also interesting in the way it created new ideas around intellectual property. The development of the Creative Commons licenses is very much inspired by the work of the Free Software movement. It remains to be seen to what extent other cultural expressions could function like Free Software and if a similar success is imaginable. One thing is sure, the kind of collaboration that software‚Äôs tool-like nature makes possible is not as well fitted to other expressions. If William Orbit scored Samuel Barber‚Äôs <em>Adagio for Strings</em> (1936) for synthesizer, he did not write to Barber‚Äôs heirs proposing to scrap acoustical instruments in all future performances of the piece. Ferry Corsten‚Äôs remix did not replace Orbit‚Äôs album version, nor did any other adaptations from the trance music era. All these versions coexist. Rather than working together on shared tools, for most artists the way to collaborate over time is to create interpretations. There is a tendency to build upon the work of others that is shared and Creative Commons licenses help make that possible.</p>
