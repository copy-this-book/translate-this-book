<h1>The Protypical Author: Writing</h1>
<p>Copyright laws don‚Äôt use the word artist, they use the word author. It‚Äôs just one of the many hints that the legal framework built around artistic creation was first constructed by and for those who write. This is perhaps why, compared to other disciplines, short of copying a text word for word, it is straightforward to write without infringing copyright.</p>
<p>Language is a technology that we fully incorporate. The metaphor that is central to copyright, that of abstract ideas expressed through an individual form as the expression of a personality, is more fitting for writing than any other medium. As a graphic designer, you need to deal with typefaces, photographs and illustrations, all of which can have copyright of their own. As a photographer, you have to deal with the personality rights of your subjects and you might even have to deal with the copyright of the clothes they are wearing. As a writer, you only need words and words in themselves do not have copyright. While we are all constructed of myriad existing texts, no-one is constructed of exactly the same ones. When confronted with a blank page, the sequence of words with which you compose thoughts will quite probably be unique.</p>
<p>When writers do run into legal trouble it is often because of the people they write about. You can read more about this in chapter 5.7, <em>People Have Rights, Too: Personalities</em>.</p>
<h2>Quotation</h2>
<p>As a writer, you have the privilege of being able to quote. In other media, even a short sample of a sound recording or a fragment cut out of a photograph can constitute copyright infringement. Whereas the freedom of writers to cite other writers is well established. Even so, for the quote to be acceptable it must take into account a number of parameters.</p>
<p>For one, the quotation should be short and support the main text. To show that the quotes support the text, the text should still be comprehensible with the quotes removed. Author Peter Longerich and his publisher Random House got into trouble because Longerich‚Äôs biography of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels quoted too extensively from his diary. Goebbels‚Äô heirs sued for copyright infringement and won.<sup>üìÉ Dalya Alberge, <em>Joseph Goebbels‚Äô Family Win Legal Battle to Be Paid Royalties for Diary Extracts</em>.</sup></p>
<p>Another requirement is to accurately mention the source. While Belgian courts have sometimes been forgiving when in specific contexts it was difficult to cite the source, French courts have been unforgiving.</p>
<p>However, if the quote is quite short, you‚Äôll have more freedom. This is because copyright infringement only deals with the parts of a work that can be considered original, and short phrases aren‚Äôt usually considered to meet that bar. This makes it possible to use all kinds of allusions without fearing infringement. When this book‚Äôs designer came up with the title, <em>Copy This Book</em>, she was playing off Abbie Hoffman‚Äôs guide to counter-cultural living <em>Steal This Book</em> (1971), just like Oakland-based hip-hop band The Coup did with <em>Steal This Album</em> (1998), later joined by Detroit punk rock band The Suicide Machines with <em>Steal This Record</em> (2001) and Armenian-American heavy metal band System of a Down with S<em>teal This Album!</em> (2002). Robert Greenwald made <em>Steal This Movie!</em> (2000) and Paraguay Press published an artist‚Äôs book by Dora Garcia entitled <em>Steal This Book</em> (2009). In such a way, catchphrases from books and movies can quickly integrate into the cultural tissue. That‚Äôs usually fine, although there can be a catch: short slogans can be trademarked. This makes their usage exclusive, though only for a specific economic context. If I want, I can compose a poem from the various slogans of Dutch supermarkets‚ÄîI just can‚Äôt use the poem to promote my own convenience store.</p>
<p>Many forms of experimental writing use collage techniques, which do not always involve attribution of sources nor see quotes as supporting a main text. T. S. Eliot still manages to colour inside the lines in <em>The Waste Land</em> (1922), going to the effort of providing footnotes so the reader can trace his sources. The poem is also not a full-on collage: it mixes quotations with original lines. From the perspective of copyright, collage poems using exclusively exterior sources can only work if the samples are from a large variety of sources and only a few words at a time, which means the sampled word-sequences are too short for copyright protection. Slicing up two newspaper articles into one new poem probably constitutes infringement: the quoted text is substantial enough to infringe copyright, and the quotations don‚Äôt support a main text. But as in the domain of visual arts, where a large part of the contemporary production reuses existing images in some way or another without clearing all the rights, such poems can fly under the radar as long as they don‚Äôt achieve mainstream notoriety.</p>
<h2>Fan fiction</h2>
<p>In her essay ‚ÄúWriting, Identity and Copyright in the Net Age,‚Äù written in 1995 when private homes first started getting internet access, Kathy Acker notes: ‚ÄúWriting, as defined by the literary industry, is all about individuals. I own my writing; that is copyright.‚Äù This ownership is predicated on the fact that you as an author write your own work. In order to partake in the literary establishment, there is a sort of double erasure that occurs in the presumption that the new text is clearly separable from texts that already exist and that the writing process is individual. While it‚Äôs economically necessary for you to present yourself as an individual, the operation can also lead you to distance yourself from the cultural history of which you are part and the social ecosystem in which you thrive. Acker writes: ‚ÄúThe loss of friendship, the giving over of friendship to business based on individualism, has caused loss of energy in the literary world [‚Ä¶] We need to regain some of the energy, as writers and as readers, that people have on the internet when for the first time they email, when they discover that they can write anything, even to a stranger, even the most personal of matters. When they discover that strangers can communicate to each other.‚Äù<sup>üìÉ Kathy Acker, <em>Writing, Identity, and Copyright in the Net Age</em>.</sup></p>
<p>One kind of writing that the internet has definitely stimulated is fan fiction. This term refers to authors writing stories set in the fictional universe of other, more well-known books. In fan fiction fans review and comment on each other‚Äôs work in vivid online communities. Because reusing these characters and worlds counts as reusing the form of the existing text, theoretically authors of fan fiction should ask permission before publishing their texts on the forums dedicated to the genre. But a kind of truce has grown between published authors and their fans. As long as the fan fiction is not commercially exploited, most authors and publishers don‚Äôt interfere. After all, the fan fiction helps to keep interest and engagement with the text that inspired it.</p>
<p>Looking into the genesis of a work of fan fiction, we can see its author project a less individualistic conception of the writing process. A writer going by the alias of Snowqueens Icedragon publishes stories on a number of fan fiction websites that explore a romantic relationship between two characters from Stephenie Meyer‚Äôs vampire book series <em>Twilight</em> (2005-08). In contrast to Meyer‚Äôs novels, where vampires prefer to wait until they‚Äôre married, Icedragon‚Äôs book narrates a sexual relationship. Their sexually explicit nature leads websites to ban the stories. Icedragon takes the matter into her own hands by starting a blog on which she posts new chapters as she finishes them.<sup>üìÉ Anne Jamison, <em>Full Exchange with Jason Boog for Npr.org Piece</em>.</sup> She exchanges with her followers and solicits their feedback: ‚ÄúThanks to Hoot for pre-reading and checking my American. Thanks also the twitterati for their continued help with the American‚Ä¶‚Äù Her fan fiction entitled <em>Master of the Universe</em> (2010) is writing for the internet age. The author is unapologetic about the work‚Äôs derivative nature and <sup>üìÉ <em>Everything Fifty Shades Of Grey: Master of the Universe</em>.</sup>engagement with her online friends during the writing.</p>
<p>The interest for <em>Master of the Universe</em> is so great, though, that Icedragon sees the economic potential. She publishes an ebook and a print-on-demand version through an Australian virtual publisher. Through word of mouth, these books start to sell exceedingly well and a major publisher secures the right for a new edition that becomes a worldwide bestseller. However, Acker‚Äôs observation still holds. To be able to exploit her work economically, Icedragon has to reimagine her project as individualist one. Before publishing her book, she takes the discussion posts offline, changes the names of the characters so their vampire pedigree is no longer apparent, picks a less fan-sounding title, <em>Fifty Shades of Gray</em>, and a new, less fan-sounding pen name, E. L. James.</p>
