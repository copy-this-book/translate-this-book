<h1>A Copy of Reality: Photographs</h1>
<p>‚ÄúIt is because of the servility of photography that I am fundamentally contemptuous of this chance invention which will never be an art but which plagiarizes nature by means of optics.‚Äù<sup>As cited in üìö Bernard Edelman, <em>Ownership of the Image: Elements for a Marxist Theory of Law</em>.</sup> In the nineteenth century, poet Alphonse de Lamartine was convinced there was no creativity in photography. Others pointed out that if any creativity existed in photographs it was in the person depicted rather than the one depicting. Today we expect creativity on both sides of the lens. If you take photographs you get copyright protection for your work. However, whatever it is you make a photograph of also has rights. People have personality rights, buildings and works of art appearing in photos have copyright and finally logos can also get trademark protection.</p>
<p>For details on the rights of the people you photograph, see chapter 5.7, <em>People Have Rights Too: Personalities</em>.</p>
<h2>Photos and the originality threshold</h2>
<p>If you take a picture, you have at least some amount of control. You will have chosen a camera model, lens, settings or film stock. You might use artificial lighting.<sup>The European Union Court of Justice has outlined this position clearly in the context of portrait photography. ‚öñ Judgment of December 1<sup>st</sup> 2011, <em>Painer</em>, C-145/10, ECLI:EU:C:2011:798, paragraphs 85‚Äì99.</sup> Even if you simply take a snapshot with your smartphone, the basic photographic elements of timing and framing remain. While in everyday language many of such pictures would not be considered original, almost all photographs qualify for copyright protection.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions. Photos made for ID documents are subject to a set of external limitations imposed by the government. These limitations limit the creativity of the photographer to the extent that the resulting photograph is no longer to be considered a creative work.<sup>üìö Philippe van Wijnen, <em>Buiten Beeld: Het Auteursrecht van Fotografen</em>.</sup> The same holds for faithful reproductions of two-dimensional images. A faithful photographic reproduction of a painting, drawing or poster requires a lot of technological skill but the photographer does not have a lot of space to creatively influence the outcome. As often happens when copyright does not cover a certain kind of intellectual labour, a number of countries created additional rights for non-creative photography. You can read more about these in chapter 6.1, <em>No Known Restrictions: Public Domain</em>.</p>
<h2>Copyright layering</h2>
<p>If someone takes an original photo and within that photo there‚Äôs a copyrighted work, what does it mean? Imagine you have made an installation and you ask a photographer to document it. In choosing the frame and lighting, they have made creative decisions. The resulting picture is copyrighted to the photographer. However, to legally reproduce the picture they need your permission because it contains your copyrighted installation. In other words, you can‚Äôt reproduce the picture without the photographer‚Äôs permission and vice versa. One way around this potential impasse is to explicitly dictate what the photographer must do at every step of the process because that would make you the author of the image. Good luck finding a photographer willing to work with you, though! A better solution is having the photographer license the image to you (see chapter 3.3, <em>Setting the Conditions of Copying: Licenses</em>).</p>
<p>Copyright stacks and layers. Like is often the case with copyright, the reasoning behind this layering seems fair. After all, in the preceding example, the power of that particular image is created in part by you and in part by the photographer. The problem is, if you take this reasoning to its extreme, it becomes very hard to take photographs without infringing copyright. If I come by your house and take your picture, do I also need to ask permission from the designers of the posters or the artists of the paintings on your walls? What about the furniture? Furniture has copyright, too. The answer to this conundrum is to establish whether or not the use of the copyrighted work is incidental.</p>
<p>Copyright allows for an incidental use of copyrighted matter. What this means is that the use of the copyrighted material must be secondary to the intended subject and must not be deliberate. A Dutch case shows how thin the edge between incidental and deliberate use can be. The news photographer Guus Dubbelman was going to take a portrait of manager Andrew Land of trading house Hagemeyer, when he noted a sculpture of an archer in the firm‚Äôs lobby of an archer. He asked Land to position himself in such a way that it looked as if the archer was taking aim at him, and took the photograph. The author of the sculpture, M.A. van Dijk, came across the photo and sued for copyright infringement. The judge sided with the sculptor and ruled that it was clear that through the choice of frame and the positioning of the model the sculpture had become a deliberate part of the photograph: the inclusion could not be considered incidental.<sup>‚öñ Volkskrant/Stichting Beeldrecht <em>IER 94/2</em>.</sup></p>
<p>For incidental use, the copyrighted elements have to be accessory and not the main subject. The French edition of the magazine <em>Elle</em> was convicted when they published pictures of the Karl Lagerfeld-designed interior of a Chanel store without mentioning the name Christian Liaigre. The latter was the designer of most of the furniture, which was the main subject of the photos. Similarly, the Parisian hotel Le Chat Noir was so fond of the Herv√© Matejewski-designed light totems that were a part of their redesigned interior that they incorporated them into the graphic design of their website. The judge pointed out that while it was permitted for the hotel to show pictures of their interior on their website, which would include the light totems, the hotel could not extract it as a graphical device to use alone.<sup>‚öñ Court of Appeal of Versailles, 31 March 2005, <em>205 RIDA 478</em> and Court of Appeal of Paris, 2 December 2011, <em>No10/15306</em>.</sup></p>
<p>If a picture is taken in a studio, since you‚Äôre thereby constructing the image yourself, it could be said you have full control over the elements you incorporate and every inclusion of a copyrighted work is therefore deliberate. It follows that you‚Äôd have to ask permission for each copyrighted element. French courts have taken this reasoning to its extreme. Photographers have been convicted for not seeking permission for the shoes models wore or for a bracelet. Filmmakers have been convicted for chairs and for tablecloths. Personally, I feel copyright has overreached in those cases. <sup>‚öñ Court of Appeal of Paris, 20 May 2011, <em>PI 399</em>; Court of Appeal of Paris, 10 February 2012, <em>RTD Comm 776</em>; Court of Cassation, 12 December 2000, <em>(2001) 1 PI 62</em>; Court of Grand Instance of Marseille (ref), 2 April 2001, <em>JurisData No 2001-144822</em>.</sup>It seems to forget that art, especially applied art, exists to be used. If I make a design for a tablecloth, then I‚Äôd like copyright to protect me from other people copying my tablecloth design. If somebody wanted to use my tablecloth as part of the d√©cor in a movie, however, they‚Äôre simply using my tablecloth for what it‚Äôs intended. In this example, while potentially benefitting some artists, copyright makes things harder for others.</p>

Architects have copyright and that is not only to make sure other firms can‚Äôt copy the buildings. Theoretically, it also makes it impossible to photograph these buildings without permission. That‚Äôs why many countries have ‚Äúfreedom of panorama,‚Äù which explicitly allows the inclusion of buildings and permanent sculptures in photographs. Within the EU, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy and Slovenia don‚Äôt currently have freedom of panorama. France introduced freedom of panorama in 2016 but only for natural persons (not for foundations or companies) and for non-commercial purposes. For example, if this book had included pictures of French rather than Belgian vistas, the freedom of panorama would not have applied for copies sold in France, because the book is published by a non‚Äëprofit foundation rather than a person. We could still, however, claim incidental use and try to show that the protected buildings are not the main subject of the photograph.</p>
