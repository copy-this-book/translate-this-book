<h1>No Ordinary Labour: Why Copyright</h1>
<p>You‚Äôve been blessed. Whenever you write, design or draw something you get to decide who can copy and adapt it. Laws are in place to grant this right and treaties and conventions make sure this is true all around the world. But why do we have these laws in the first place? There are a number of possible answers and in discussions around copyright they tend to get mixed up. Let‚Äôs examine them up close.</p>
<h2>Because it‚Äôs mine</h2>
<p>As an artist you are able to take an abstract idea and give it form, creating a unique and original expression. It is a common intuition that, because you are the person who made it, the expression should belong to you. Yet unlike with, say, your bicycle, someone can go along and copy your expression when you‚Äôre not looking. Since nothing was stolen in the way that a bike can be stolen (your expression did not disappear), the regular laws over physical property don‚Äôt apply. In order to deal with this intangible, intellectual property we needed new laws.</p>
<p>You could understand this solution in the frame of individual rights<em>,</em> as copyright is primarily a right for human individuals. This view seems to be be supported by the International Declaration of Human Rights, Article 27.2: ‚ÄúEveryone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he [<em>sic</em>] is the author.‚Äù<sup>‚öñ <em>Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</em></sup></p>
<p>This individual view of copyright is quite important within the legal tradition of continental Europe. It even comes through in the word used for copyright. If the English word ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù suggests a legal provision to regulate acts of copying without making explicit who benefits, in most European languages copyright translates to ‚Äúauthors‚Äô rights‚Äù: <em>direito autoral</em> in Portuguese, <em>autori√µigus</em> in Estonian, <em>opphavsrett</em> in Norwegian. With the focus on authors, any benefits of copyright for the public or society are simply a bonus. In an article on moral rights, the French law scholar Henri Desbois claims ‚Äúcopyright seeks to protect the author, not society.‚Äù<sup>üìÉ Henri Desbois, <em>Le droit moral</em>.</sup></p>
<p>There is no country in which copyright protects the author‚Äôs rights absolutely, though. That‚Äôs because, beside the author, there is also the public. And the public, which obviously includes authors, has rights as well. In the Declaration of Human Rights, the paragraph preceding the one cited above reads: ‚ÄúEveryone has the right to freely participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.‚Äù</p>
<p>Yet copyright poses plenty of restrictions to freely participating in cultural life. Copyright holders determine the conditions of access‚Äîthey can make it expensive to read a book, access a scientific paper, watch a movie, play a song. Furthermore, the artists and publishers who hold copyright can shape how others make use of their work. Given that the cultural life of a community exists through adaptations, reprisals and variations on existing works, communities depend on rights-holders to sanction their participation in culture.</p>
<p>There is thus an intuition that copyright should accommodate the interests of the public. One possible approach would be to make copyright weaker‚Äîto allow for broader citations and transformations of existing works. However, as we see in chapter 2, <em>The Rights to Your Expression:</em> <em>The Basics of Copyright</em>, EU copyright presently allows for few exceptions to author or owner control. The way European countries have attempted to strike a balance is by making copyright limited in time. The existence of the public domain is thus intended to balance out the limitations on accessing and adapting copyrighted work. All members of the public can freely interact with works in the public domain.</p>
<p>If you want to read Jane Austen‚Äôs <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (1813), the text is in the public domain and it is easy to access. Major publishers offer cheap paperback versions. If you prefer an e-reader or smartphone, there are plenty of free versions online, including from Project Gutenberg. You also have a choice of adaptations. Both Dutch and Italian television made <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> mini-series, while since 1952 the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has produced one roughly every fifteen years. For movie buffs, there is the United States film adaptation of 1940 and the UK-US collaboration of 2005. Other movie adaptations set the story among the Indian elite or Utah Mormons. And in the sphere of online mashups and memes, there‚Äôs <em>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em>, both as a 2009 novel and a 2016 movie.</p>
<h2>Because it‚Äôs useful</h2>
<p>Another way to think of copyright is as a useful tool, rather than a human right. Such an approach could be called utilitarian, and is often associated with the Anglo-Saxon world, countries where there is no ‚Äúauthors‚Äù in the term ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù. One of the very first copyright laws to resemble those we have today is the 1710 Statute of Anne. It is a modern copyright law in that it ensures the rights are with the author, initially, rather than with the publisher. Nevertheless, from its formal title we learn that protecting authors is not the statute‚Äôs first intention: <em>An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by Vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of Copies, during the Times therein mentioned</em>. In 1788, the US constitution explains the rationale behind copyright law as such: ‚ÄúTo promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.‚Äù<sup>‚öñ <em>The Constitution of the United States</em>.</sup></p>
<p>In both cases, the language suggests that authors‚Äô rights aren‚Äôt just protected as an end unto itself, but because they serve societal progress. In this view, copyright puts the public back in the equation; it serves culture before it serves artists. Copyright is seen as an incentive to create new culture. The claim is that artists are emboldened by copyright: Now you are able to commercially exploit the fruits of your labour, you will be more tempted to create new works. Or, because you are able to receive income from your existing works, you will be able to create new ones. Note, the motivation here is not exactly the same as the one that says all artists deserve to be paid, another popular pro-copyright argument. Rather, this line of reasoning presumes it‚Äôs a good thing that artists get paid because that is what makes culture thrive, and making culture thrive is the end goal.</p>
<p>Some aspects of the pre-1989, pre-Berne Convention US copyright system exemplify this position. For example, copyright needed to be registered, which posed an additional burden for artists but made it much simpler for anyone wanting to publish or reuse a work to find the rights-holder. Copyright was also much shorter. The first copyright act in the US, passed in 1790, established a 14-year copyright with a 14-year extension, which was prolonged to 28 years with a 28-year extension in 1909. The extension was not automatic, however. Since, in practice, a work‚Äôs commercial exploitation tends to happen quickly or not at all, the rights-holder would only apply for an extension in the case of a successful exploitation. It‚Äôs only in 1976 that a period of 50 years after the author‚Äôs death is introduced in the US. This had already been the copyright term in France since 1866. However, when all EU countries moved to 70 years in 1997, it took the US only a year to match up and lengthen the term as well.</p>
<p>If we look at the state of copyright today, whether in the US or elsewhere, it does not seem like it was designed from the utilitarian perspective described above. If that were the case, you would expect copyright to last only as long as it can serve its purpose of stimulating the creation of new work. This would mean to take into account the average length of time an artist is able to exploit their work economically. In reality, as an artist, you are really very lucky if a new work is economically valuable for more than a decade. Most books never get reprinted, most albums never get reissued, and most artworks sold in a gallery never get sold again. From a utilitarian perspective, a copyright of 15 years after publication might be more than enough.<sup>Economist and mathematician Rufus Pollock, one of the many theoreticians who tried to model this problem, came up with 15 years: üìÉ Rufus Pollock, <em>Forever Minus a Day? Calculating Optimal Copyright Term</em>.</sup> Instead, today‚Äôs copyright can easily last more than 100 years.</p>
<p>Another aspect of copyright that makes little sense from this perspective, is the stringent interpretation of derivative works. In France, for example, studio photographers need to ask permission to shoot everything from chairs to tablecloths featured in their work (see chapter 17, <em>A Copy of Reality: Photographs</em>). In this way, copyright makes it harder for them to create. Moreover, for producers of tablecloths and chairs, copyright licensing is only a marginal revenue stream‚Äîtheir business is to sell tablecloths and chairs. So, in this case, is the creative and economic burden posed by copyright worth it? Well, because France follows the perspective of individual artists‚Äô rights, the question doesn‚Äôt even arise. The rights of the artist being cited are seen as more important than whatever inconvenience these rights may cause.</p>
<h2>Why copyright today</h2>
<p>Of the two approaches popular in motivating copyright‚Äîindividual rights and public utility‚Äîindividual rights is the strongest today. Continental Europeans like to play up the difference between the supposedly more mercantile US approach and the countries that give more power to authors, but the truth is that from 1989 onwards the globalised economy has functioned with a copyright system whose basic functioning is remarkably uniform: long copyright terms, immediate protection and no registration.</p>
<p>As an artist, you can benefit from this strong protection of your individual rights. In practice, the most important aspect is that copyright occurs immediately. You don‚Äôt need to add a legally-worded message to your work, nor register it with an office. This means you‚Äôll always have at least some leverage over anyone who tries to publish your work without your cooperation. This is great, notably while you‚Äôre still looking for the right context for the work to appear. Conversely, as you‚Äôll see throughout the book, strict rights can also make it more difficult to create.</p>
