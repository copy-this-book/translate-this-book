<h1>Setting the Conditions of¬†Copying: Licenses</h1>
<p>Because of copyright, it takes permission from an artist to re‚Äëuse their work. A license is a document in which this permission is detailed. As an artist, you will get to both obtain licenses from other artists, and issue licenses yourself.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, you do not need a license document to grant or get permission. Legally, even an oral message counts. Or a simple e-mail. Like with any kind of contracts, a written license is an attempt to avoid future confusion by stating in the most clear wording what is being shared and under what conditions.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve ever needed to get a license for an image, chances are you were in contact with a company and not with an artist. This is because, as an artist, you can assign your copyright to someone else, or to a company. It can be quite an investigation to find out who the rights holder is.</p>
<p>Assigning your copyright is not the same as issuing a license. You can assign your copyright for a specific work only once: from that point on the work belongs to the other. Once you‚Äôve signed over your copyright, it‚Äôs no longer up to you to commercially exploit the work. You might receive royalties, as stipulated in your contract, but you no longer have an active role in deciding who gets to reproduce your work and under what conditions. Many traditional publishing contracts require you to assign your copyright to the publisher (see the chapter 3.2, <em>Mutual Dependency: Publishers</em>). Employers will also make you want to assign your copyright, as detailed in chapter 5.3, <em>Mixed Authorship is the Norm: Graphic Design</em>. Finally, if you work on a large scale production such as a feature film, the production company will also want you to sign over copyright.</p>
<p>If you do still have the copyright, and others are interested in re-using your work, you can also issue them a license. You can tune the license with regards to the parameters that follow.</p>
<h2>Scope of the license</h2>
<p>You can choose to license the creation of reproductions only for specific uses. For example, you give someone the right to use your photograph in a specific issue of a magazine. The idea is that if they want to use it again in another context, it is a different kind of use and they‚Äôll have to re-negotiate.</p>
<p>If you are negotiating with another artist to include their work in your project, such a scoped license is usually fine. However, you should be careful about scoping too narrowly, otherwise the license can become a burden on how you can exploit your own work! For example, if you obtain a license to use someone‚Äôs photograph in your printed publication, you‚Äôll want to have a license that will also be valid for future editions, and for an eventual electronic edition of the publication.</p>
<h2>Exclusive vs. non-exclusive</h2>
<p>An exclusive license makes sure that only the one person or company who signs the license agreement can use the work, and no-one else. A non-exclusive license gives the copyright holder the freedom to license the work again on other occasions to other parties. An exclusive license could therefore be more expensive.</p>
<p>You should be careful with granting exclusive licenses. After all, you will loose the capacity to use the work even yourself. If someone proposes you to license your work exclusively, you can try and convince them that a non-exclusive license would work as well. Otherwise, there are some strategies to alleviate the possible drawbacks of an exclusive license. For example, you can issue a license that becomes non-exclusive after a given time-frame. An option that is often used in publishing contracts is that the exclusive license remains valid for as long as the licensee actively exploits the work. For example, if someone exclusively licenses your images to use in a book, you can add a term that the license is valid as long as the book is in print.</p>
<p>If you are negotiating with another artist to include their work in your project, you usually won‚Äôt need to ask for an exclusive license. After all, if you like the artist and their work, why not let it have a live outside your project as well? An exclusive license does make sense, for example, with pictures taken for a publicity campaign.</p>
<h2>Perpetual vs. fixed term</h2>
<p>Unless mentioned otherwise, a license is forever. The copyright holder can stipulate for the license to have a shorter duration though. Licenses that are limited in time can be cheaper.</p>
<p>It might seem attractive to issue fixed term licenses. After all, you will be able to make money again if the work keeps being exploited beyond the license term.</p>
<p>However, if you are negotiating with another artist to include their work in your project, you should by all means try to avoid a fixed term. This is because, again, the license can become a burden on how you can exploit your own work. You become quite dependent on the licenser. There are no legal safeguards that stop them from jacking up the prize for consecutive license terms.</p>
<p>Licensing that is not perpetual is also a bad deal for the public. The exploitation of older works is not necessarily economically attractive. Cultural institutions, hobbyists, and small publishers often play a role in keeping culture accessible. They will have to acquire permission of the copyright holders of these works, which by itself is no small feat. If these older works then contain licensed elements whose licensing is not perpetual, these elements can prove to be prohibitive in keeping the work accessible.</p>
<h2>Local vs. global</h2>
<p>You can limit your license to a geographical area, for example a list of nation states or a continent. An example could be your publisher, who has distribution mainly in Europe, licensing another publisher for distribution in Asia.</p>
<p>Even with digital content geographically limited licenses exist. Broadcasting companies often operate on a national level, so if a TV channel in your country has secured the rights for a TV-series, you won‚Äôt find it on Mubi or Netflix. That is, as long as you‚Äôre at home. In a foreign hotel you‚Äôll find the offer has changed.<sup>When former Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip became a member of the European Parliament in 2014, he¬†decided to tackle a personal annoyance: he¬†could not watch Estonian football matches from his hotel rooms in other E.U. countries. Progress in this field has been slow but undeniable, so it could well be that in the future geo-blocking will no longer be a thing within the E.U.</sup></p>
<p>If you are negotiating with another artist to include their work in your project, you should avoid local licenses. Art projects travel.</p>
<h2>Personal vs. general</h2>
<p>The license documents we have treated up until now are personal, negotiated for a specific occasion. It is also possible to create a more general license document. Social web platforms, for example, have you agree to their End User License Agreements, a part of which is a copyright license from you to them. After all, the application needs your permission to show the material you upload to other users.</p>
<p>As an artist, you can also create a general license for your work. Instead of making a deal with someone in particular, you stipulate how anyone can use your work. It is perfectly possible to state on your website the terms under which your work can be reproduced. If you say nothing, the default is copyright (that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt need these serious sounding legal notices!), but historically artists have tried to unburden their work from copyright limitations. Situationists marked their texts: ‚ÄúAll texts published in Internationale Situationniste may be freely reproduced, translated or adapted, even without indication of origin.‚Äù In ‚ÄòRevolting Librarians‚Äô, Celeste West writes: ‚ÄúD(…î) Copy. Do Something. No rights reserved. No wrongs preserved.‚Äù<sup>üìö Celeste West and Elizabeth Katz, <em>Revolting Librarians</em>.</sup></p>

<p>Sometimes, legal innovations are not made by lawyers, but by creative software programmers. The 1989 publication of the GNU General Public License, by Richard Stallman, a software license, was a clever hack.</p>
<p>The GNU Public License reads:</p>
<blockquote>The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software‚Äîto make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation‚Äôs software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.<sup>‚öñ Free Software Foundation, Inc., <em>GNU General Public License, Version 2</em>.</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>The license goes on to stipulate a number of freedoms for the licensee: you are able to freely use the software, modify it, and distribute both the original and modified versions. These freedoms come with an obligation: any new additions to the software will have to come under the same GPL. This last feature is also known as ‚Äòcopyleft‚Äô, (…î), or a ‚Äòviral license‚Äô.</p>
<p>The GPL stimulates users to share and to collaborate. Stallman envisioned a completely free operating system, a vision which later came true with the Linux kernel, a core part of an Operating System that together with the GNU software and a number of other packages became the Linux operating system. The movement got rebranded as ‚ÄòOpen Source‚Äô (to the chagrin of Stallman) and new licenses appeared (not all of them copyleft). Because the software under the GPL was freely available, modifiable and solicits contributions from its users, and because the Linux kernel could run on cheap hardware, it soon made up the bulk of the infrastructure of the nascent world wide web. While its inroads on the server are the most impressive, Free Software also found its way to desktop computer users. The most well known success on the desktop is undoubtedly Mozilla Firefox, which introduced such features as tabbed browsing and ad-blocking.</p>
<p>The success of Open Source proved to be hugely inspiring to makers in other fields. That is partly because the early GPL period coincided with an increasing overreach of copyright, exemplified by the Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act (1998) and the addition of intellectual property protection to the TRIPS agreement (1995). In this sense the GPL seemed a refreshing alternative. The most well known project to bring the concepts of Free Software to other cultural productions is called Creative Commons, and was founded in 2002.</p>
<p>Creative Commons works by providing you with copyright licenses that you can apply to your work which make it clear that you are allowing it to be re-used. There are other licenses that were designed for artistic purposes: in the French speaking world, the Free Art License has some traction. Creative Commons is the most successful though. According to Creative Commons‚Äô yearly report for 2017, photo sharing website Flickr alone hosts over 400 million CC licensed images. Next in line are Wikipedia and Wikimedia commons, who together host over 80 million media.<sup>üìÉ Creative Commons, <em>State of the Commons 2017</em>.</sup> DeviantArt, Youtube, Vimeo, Soundcloud all offer options to find and upload CC licensed media.</p>
<h2>Why and when Creative Commons</h2>
<p>So why would you want to use an open license, if you could make money by according reproductions on a case by case basis? Why would you want to preemptively give people the right to reproduce your work? A part of the answer lies in the chapter: ‚ÄòCopyright and money‚Äô. For some artists, notably visual artists, exploiting their copyrights is not at the core of their business model. It‚Äôs not like your copyrighted work will make money by itself: finding licensing opportunities takes time and effort.</p>
<p>If your income is already covered because you get grants, sell labour or sell art-works, open licenses can be very attractive. The up-sides to licensing your work under an open license, is that you open it up to a larger audience, that you allow the ideas in it to spread, and that you tell people that you are open to them re-imagining, translating and adapting what you made.</p>
<p>Creative Commons provides a number of possible licenses. They differ in how exactly you allow others to make use of your work. Their baseline license is Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY). It provides others the possibility to use, modify and re-distribute the work. The requirement is that the artist‚Äôs name is mentioned. If you want, you can adapt the license with the following modifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share-alike (SA): a copyleft provision. Any re-use of the work should be published with the same license.</li>
<li>Non-commercial (NC): the copy can only be used in a non-profit situation: in education, research, ngo‚Äôs and in amateur contexts.</li>
<li>Non-derivative (ND): the work can not be modified, only redistributed.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can combine these building blocks into 6 licenses: CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND, CC BY-NC-SA and CC BY-NC-ND.</p>
<p>What the CC licenses have in common is that they are non-exclusive, perpetual, world-wide and general: once you‚Äôve decided upon the conditions, they apply for everybody everywhere, and they stay the same. However, you can still make your own custom licenses for the uses that don‚Äôt fall under your CC license. For example, if you‚Äôve licensed your work under a license with a non-commercial clause, you can grant specific personal licenses for any commercial uses.</p>
<p>Creative Commons also provides the CC0, which strictly speaking is not a license, but rather a waiver: you declare to give up your copyrights completely, as much as the law allows. It is similar to consecrating a work to the public domain.</p>
<p>So which license should you use? In general, CC BY is fine. Personally I would never use the ND modifier, since it goes against the philosophy of cultural exchange upon which Creative Commons is built. SA makes a lot of sense if you envision your work part of a larger project that should remain free and accessible. Wikipedia is SA for example. NC is controversial among Open Source advocates because it removes a lot of potential types of re-use. There could be tons of interesting use of your work in small scale experimental publications, but as long as they charge money, the use is considered commercial, and a NC license won‚Äôt do.</p>
<p>For this book, I did go with NC. The reasoning is that I wanted to work together with a publisher. Because it‚Äôs NC, the publisher still needs my permission to publish and sell the printed book. This means I have a say in choosing the publisher, and they in turn get the assurance that no-one else will sell the printed book. The illustrations I contributed are licensed under CC BY though. This way, they can spread the most easily possible, helping to convey the ideas of this book and attract new¬†readers.</p>
<h2>Using Creative Commons licensed media</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre looking to incorporate Creative Commons media into your project, it is quite straightforward, or at least more straightforward than acquiring copyright licenses the traditional way. There are only a limited number of options; that‚Äôs also why you are not allowed to add additional restrictions on top of the CC license.</p>
<p>The first challenge though, is to find CC-licensed media. Many of the different platforms that host CC media are commercial companies that also allow their users to upload traditionally copyrighted work. You might have to dig into the options to limit your search results to CC. It‚Äôs not always mentioned as such. As of the time of writing, Soundcloud for example gives you the options ‚ÄúTo listen to‚Äù, ‚ÄúTo share‚Äù, ‚ÄúTo use commercially‚Äù and ‚ÄúTo modify commercially‚Äù, without telling you which licenses these represent exactly. Website 500px even removed access to the CC-licensed photos on its website after it changed its monetisation strategy. Non-profits such as Wikimedia Commons and Archive.org tend to be more transparent, and only host contents with open licenses.</p>
<p>When integrating CC-licensed works into your own, the ideal licenses are CC0, CC BY and CC BY-SA. Non-commercial is an option if you know beforehand that the context is going to stay non-commercial. It‚Äôs great in an educational setting for example. For self-initiated works it is less than ideal: you might not be making money initially, but what happens for example if a newspaper picks up on your work and wants to feature it? Their use is commercial, because they sell newspapers. If it would have been your own work that was licensed NC, you could have overruled the license for the occasion. But since you‚Äôre using another artist‚Äôs work, you can‚Äôt decide for them.</p>
<p>Share-alike is interesting. It means that if you create a modified version of the work, it needs to stay licensed under the same license. Otherwise, it is quite possible to make a new copyrighted item out of CC sources. For example, if you cut and paste elements from CC BY-licensed photographs to create a collage, your new work is copyrighted by default. SA prevents that, requiring you to re-license your new work under the same terms. However, if you re-use an SA licensed illustration or photograph as a separate element within a larger publication, the license of the rest of the publication is not affected.</p>
<p>For any CC license, there is the requirement of attribution. Since in most European countries you can‚Äôt waive your moral rights of attribution even if you wanted to, theoretically you even need to credit CC0 works. According to Creative Commons, an ideal credit line is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúDesign for Consumer Society. Planned Obsolescence, Styling and Irresponsible Objects‚Äù by Marjanne van Helvert is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case you mention the title, the author and the license. If¬†you‚Äôre online, you can link to the item‚Äôs original location. You always need to provide a link to the license and its version number. The person that will distribute or reuse your work cannot agree with a license if they don't know where to find it. In the case of printed work you can write the complete url in a colophon or table of images. Of course you might be constricted by space; what you should in the very least add: the name of the author and the license. If it‚Äôs a derivative work, you should make that clear. Like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diagram adapted from p. 33 of ‚ÄúTraining for Exploitation? Politicising Employability and Reclaiming Education‚Äù by Precarious Workers Brigade; diagram by Precarious Workers Brigade and Evening Class, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To apply a Creative Commons License to your own work is just as easy. The CC website provides copy and paste examples. This book, for example, has written on the first page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial. The complete license text can be found at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That‚Äôs all it takes. You‚Äôve changed your work‚Äôs legal status away from its default, all rights reserved, where every reproduction needs to be vetted by you. For at least a part of those reproductions, you‚Äôve now taken yourself out of the equation.</p>
