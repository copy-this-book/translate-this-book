<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>If you’re an artist, there are laws that are made specifically for you. These laws allow you to control the ways you make your work public, and potentially provide ways to make money. They also delimit the kinds of copies you can and cannot make as part of your creative process. The principles of these laws are not difficult; it’s the details that can become messy. Messy, but fascinating. When looking at how the law works, you’ll see it comes with its own philosophy of what artistic creation really is.</p>
<p>I’ve written this guide for artists in the widest sense of the word—not just visual artists, but also writers, designers, photographers and any combination of these. If you work with music, software, typefaces and performance, I’ve also got you in mind. Today many artists don’t tie themselves to any one medium, and we also move across different business models, often simultaneously. That can mean working alone, in a collective or for a studio; with a gallery or online; on self-initiated projects or on a commission basis. Some of your projects may be completely DIY and others may be in collaboration with professional intermediaries. You’ll get to understand how the workings of copyright shift with all of these configurations. To the extent that we will explore the question of making money, the primary audience for this book is professional creative workers. At the same time, amateurs wanting to know the basics of intellectual property law will also find it useful. It used to be that copyright lawsuits were fought out between publishers, yet today anyone can publish online and find themselves confronted with a legal challenge.</p>
<p>You might wonder how to obtain copyright protection for your works. It may well be easier than you imagine—the law gives you lots of rights. More than ever, in fact. <em>Copy This Book</em> explains all of them. You will learn how to leverage your copyright when negotiating with publishers and clients (that’s the ‘making money’ part). And you will learn how to intervene when someone copies your work without permission.</p>
<p>You might also wonder whether your work infringes on the copyright of others. Where is the line between inspiration and plagiarism? Copyright is pretty intense. You probably already know you can’t use someone else’s photograph as part of your work without permission, but do you know you need permission to make a drawing after such a photograph?</p>
<p>The paradox of copyright for artists is that it works for and against you. You get control over the distribution of your work, yet the creation of this work becomes more complicated when every part related to another person’s work could be a copyright infringement. We will see how copyright works across a range of media, always from the perspective of both the artist who first put it out there and the artist who wants to reuse it. For example, we address a photograph from the perspective of its photographer and from the perspective of the visual artist appropriating it; a building from the perspective of its architect and the photographer who uses it as a backdrop for a series of portraits.</p>
<p><em>Copy This Book</em> has another goal, too. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, artists, writers and philosophers played major roles in the conception of copyright. Today, others speak for us. The image of the precarious artist is used by the media industry to justify ever stronger laws. Protecting artists and helping them make a living is the kind of noble mission any politician can be drawn to. And judges, too. Once laws are in place, the real knowledge of how they work comes from the way decisions are made in court. As you will see throughout this book, courts make artistic decisions such as: Is this an accidental or a deliberate copy? Is this work a parody or a straight imitation? Are these characters fictional or biographical? In so doing, the judiciary work from a certain idea of what it means to make art. As artists, we can insert ourselves in this process. We know what we need to make a living better than the industry does. And there is no reason to leave it up to politicians and lobbyists to conceptualise how creativity is defined legally. <em>Copy This Book</em> helps prepare you to be part of the debate on copyright today.</p>
<p>A number of artists have gone further than debating copyright and started intervening in the legal framework around artistic creation as a part of their work. Antoine Defoort creates humorous performances that recount the history of copyright and show in real-time how it regulates creativity. Céline Manz aims to find out how the act of making public can influence the legal and artistic status of an œuvre. Curator and new media artist Antonio Roberts organises group shows that focus on art projects that question or transgress intellectual property laws. Kobe Matthys organises assemblies where legally disputed ‘things’ become the subject of a debate amongst invited legal professionals and the public. These artistic practices feel related to the work of activists such as Carl Malamud, who creates effective, humorous campaigns to liberate locked-up public domain works, and of academics such as legal scholar Andrea Wallace, who created the research-led exhibition experiment <em>Display At Your Own Risk</em> (2016), which tests how far you can go with the digital surrogates of heritage works made available by cultural institutions.</p>
<p>The subculture of Free and Open Source software houses another group of makers who fashion the law in their own image. Software developers have created their own variations on copyright in order to collaborate promiscuously with one another. From where I write in Brussels, the worlds of Free software and art encounter each other often. I’m lucky to have collaborated with Constant VZW, who operate at the intersection of art, free software and feminism, and with Open Source Publishing, a design collective that works exclusively with experimental Open Source software.</p>
<p>The majority of books on copyright are written by lawyers and legal scholars who are interested in art. As an artist interested in law, I hope this book reflects a different, lived-through understanding of creative practice. A note on terminology: I use artist and author as synonyms, whereas in legal theory artist tends to refer to performing artists.</p>
<p>If this were another book, you could read somewhere in the first pages that all rights are reserved. You could read that you shouldn’t copy this book, followed by a long list of ways in which it could potentially be reproduced, whole or in part, including on quaint mediums like microfilm. If this were another book, you would need to ask my permission to read from it in public, and to photocopy or scan parts of it to use in articles or presentations. You could not photograph spreads and put them online, nor store them on microfilm, if you’re that way inclined. In reality, in the case of <em>Copy This Book</em>, I’ve taken steps to ensure you can do all these things, legally. The one thing one cannot do is reprint the entire book and sell it. These freedoms and restrictions are detailed in the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license applied to this book.</p>
<h2>A note on the international perspective</h2>
<p>Today, more than ever, the copyright legislations of most countries are the result of a large number of international treaties and trade agreements. The most important of these is the Berne Convention, which has been signed by the vast majority of countries in the world<sup>Countries that have not signed the Berne Convention: Angola, Cambodia, East Timor, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, San Marino, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Taiwan and Uganda.</sup>. This means the major concepts of copyright are the same almost everywhere. That said, most countries have their own additional laws and ways of interpreting copyright. This book was written in Brussels, the capital of the European Union (EU), and is thus focused on the EU context, with a strong emphasis on Belgium, France and the Netherlands. The EU has harmonised aspects of intellectual property law, but there are still differences among member states. Where possible, I point them out. You will note the United States also appears often on these pages. For those who do their online searches in English, many legal questions are likely to receive answers from a US perspective. Yet the US approach differs in several ways from that of the EU member states. <em>Copy This Book</em> will show you how. With the web making it easier than ever to work across international borders, it is very probable you will be confronted with different legal systems at the same time.</p>
