<h1>The Artist‚Äôs Honour: Moral Rights</h1>
<p>Copyright doesn‚Äôt only serve artists, it also serves publishers. There‚Äôs a special part, though, that is wholly reserved for creators (and their heirs): moral rights. What they protect is not your income but your honour.</p>
<p>One of the underlying philosophies upon which copyright is based, is the close link between author and work. This philosophy was already elaborated by Johann Gottlieb Fichte in the late eighteenth century. According to Fichte, someone who walks into a bookstore and buys a book never wholly owns it. They might own the physical object, they might make use of the ideas contained therein, but the specific expression of the ideas contained in the book is the unique product of the author‚Äôs mind, which is why the author retains an amount of ownership and control over it.<sup>‚öñ Martha Woodmansee, <em>The Author, Art, and the Market: Rereading the History of Aesthetics</em>.</sup></p>
<p>In practice the power copyright gives to artists tends to diminish as their work gets published because, in order for works to be distributed, copyright needs to be assigned to publishers or at least licensed. In many cases, this means it is publishers not creators who decide the contexts in which a work can be used and reused. Moral rights are an effort to maintain the close link between you and your work. They introduce a number of rights that stay with the artist, even if they no longer own copyright. This means, to an extent, that artists always have a say in how their work is used.</p>
<p>The extent to which moral rights are recognised is less harmonised amongst countries than are other parts of copyright law. Traditionally, moral rights are more extensive in continental Europe. Even if their seeds already existed in the nineteenth century, it is only after World War II that Germany and France in particular set to work implementing such laws. This push was part of a larger cultural policy to establish an identity as <em>Kulturnationen</em>, cultured nations. Focusing on the rights of artists helped to differentiate continental legal and cultural policies from those of the US (deemed to subordinate the artist to the needs of the market) and those of the Soviet Union (deemed to to subordinate the artist to the needs of the public).<sup>üìö Peter Baldwin, <em>The Copyright Wars: Three Centuries of Trans-Atlantic Battle</em>.</sup></p>
<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>The Berne Convention provides for the following rights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[‚Ä¶] the author shall have the right to claim authorship of the work and to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the said work, which would be prejudicial to his [sic] honour or reputation.<sup>‚öñ <em>Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works</em>.</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first right, to claim authorship, has in many countries been expanded to ‚Äúthe right of attribution.‚Äù This means every reproduction of a work needs to properly credit its original author. The second right, to object to any distortion of a work, has been codified as the ‚Äúright of the integrity of the work.‚Äù It is of course difficult to prove which modifications are ‚Äúprejudicial to the honour or reputation‚Äù of the artist. Belgium and France take the approach that any modification can violate the integrity of the work. In other countries you must demonstrate how the modification affects reputation.</p>
<p>An additional moral right that is encoded in Belgium and France is the ‚Äúright of divulgation‚Äù. This means that it is the author alone who decides that their work is ready to be shared with the public.</p>
<p>So, what do moral rights do for you in practice? They basically provide an extra layer of control over the reproduction of a work. Copyright serves to control whether or not someone can copy your work. Moral rights are applied on top in order to determine whether a copy respects the integrity of the work. If you‚Äôve licensed a photograph through an image library, you may still object if it gets cropped; if it‚Äôs your gallery that decides who can screen your video, you may still object if someone screens it with the wrong aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Examples of material modifications to a work that have been found to infringe on moral rights include poor reproduction; modification of the shape of a logo; showing a movie using a video cassette instead of 35mm film; cropping, deep-etching, shortening or in some other way modifying photographs; reproducing an excerpt of a work.<sup>üìÉ Julien Cabay and Maxime Lambrecht, <em>Remix Prohibited: How Rigid EU Copyright Laws Inhibit Creativity</em>.</sup></p>
<p>Of course, such modifications often happen together with a copyright violation. In this case, the violation of moral rights is possible ground for extra damages. An example would be bloggers who infringe upon copyright by using photographs without permission. Most blog software can automatically create thumbnail images for index pages or social media previews. Because thumbnails need fixed aspect-ratios, generating them often involves cropping the images. In determining their damage claims, the photographer can sue not just for copyright infringement but also for the damage to their moral rights inflicted by the thumbnail crops.</p>
<h2>Artists vs. Artists</h2>
<p>When moral rights allow you to be facetious about the way your work is reproduced, they can have quite a positive effect. However, they can get more complicated when it comes to multiple layers of artists.</p>
<p>In the performing arts, authorship is always layered. There might be a text, but this text is the starting point of a series of interpretations by a director, scenographer and performers. Some authors for the theatre try to use their moral rights to make sure the resulting play is faithful to their vision of the text. After his publisher had given the initial ‚ÄúOK‚Äù for a performance of one of his plays, Samuel Beckett insisted on the stage directions being executed faithfully. Notably, he objected to his characters being played by women. Beckett had the leeway to do so under French law and, after all, could check the reproductions for their integrity himself. Beckett‚Äôs estate kept this battle going after his death. A year before, in 1988, Dutch courts had ruled in favour of theatre directors. The judge explained it was the opinion of the courts that the play‚Äôs themes of existential insecurity came through well and this proved the integrity of the piece to be intact. In 1992, French judges initially ruled that actors read a letter of protest from the estate before each performance but in the appeals court the show was finally banned entirely. The Beckett estate managed to get two different stagings banned in Germany in 2004, whereas in 2006 Italian courts allowed a performance in which the theatre argued they had cast women to play men, not women to play women.<sup>üìÉ Trouw, <em>Vrouwen Winnen van Beckett</em>, NRC, <em>Uitspraak rechtbank in Frankrijk: Vrouwen mogen de mannelijke rollen ‚ÄòGodot‚Äô niet spelen</em>, Friederike Gr√§ff, <em>Die haben keine Prostata</em>, Barbara McMahon, <em>Beckett Estate Fails to Stop Women Waiting for Godot</em>.</sup></p>
<p>If you work within the field of conceptual or relational art, you might easily be confronted with moral rights. Interested in inhabiting the role of a censor, the Belgian conceptual artist Jan Verhaeghe put hazard tape around 21 sculptures in his place of residence, Bruges, along with the text ‚Äúforbidden to look.‚Äù The work could be interpreted as denigrating. Most public sculptures in Bruges are realist bronze statues and, while popular with much of the population, they certainly do not conform to the prevailing fashion in institutionalised contemporary art. A more charitable interpretation would be that Verhaeghe was trying to question who gets to decide which art inhabits public space. Whereas much of the arts funding in Flanders is distributed in dialogue with a committee of arts professionals, the sculptures in Bruges were placed on the initiative of Bruges‚Äô mayor in the 1980s. Livia Canestraro and Stefaan Depuydt, the artists responsible for <em>The Lovers</em>, one of the sculptures involved in Verhaeghe‚Äôs intervention, sued him. After eight years of legal battles, the Belgian appeals court decided Verhaeghe had infringed upon the moral rights of Canestraro and Depuydt. He had to pay damages and the cost of legal proceedings. In this case, Verhaeghe clearly did not infringe copyright; he did not copy the sculpture. He also did not vandalise or otherwise directly modify <em>The Lovers</em>. Yet the judge ruled that placing the hazard tape did constitute a modification of the work‚Äîa modification which was a threat to the ‚Äúhonour, fame and image of the artists.‚Äù Now, while it is usually legally quite safe to attack the honour of artists as human beings, this particular case shows you have to be more careful when it comes to their work.<sup>üìÉ Jan Misselyn, <em>Klassejustitie Bestaat Nog: 21.500 Euro Voor Een Signalisatielint</em>.</sup></p>

<p>Moral rights are a recognition of the close link between artist and work. They are also a recognition that copyright doesn‚Äôt just serve economic, but also artistic interests. When the judiciary talks about ‚Äúhonour‚Äù it may sound quaint. A sociologist might rather discuss how artists accrue cultural capital through associating with the right publishers.<sup>üìö Pierre Bourdieu, <em>Les r√®gles de l‚Äôart: gen√®se et structure du champ litt√©raire</em> is the classic on this subject (translated in English as: <em>The Rules of Art</em>), but a more easily accessible introduction is Hans Abbing, <em>Why Are Artists Poor? The Exceptional Economy of the Arts</em>.</sup> And an art historian might focus on how artists make meaning through carefully orchestrating the way their work is shown, in order to construct an oeuvre. None of these perspectives pertain exclusively to moral rights; copyright itself already gives artists control over the context of the work‚Äôs publication. Moral rights simply allow you to extend this control further. They allow you to continue to shape your work even when you have already assigned its copyright or licensed its use to others.</p>
<p>Such a close link between art and maker is not self-evident. Firstly, it is a romantic construction that art is necessarily personal, individual‚Äîin other eras you would have been considered a craftsperson or messenger for divinities. Secondly, any analysis of this infamous link will show it is not constant over time but historically contingent. Finally, the artwork is by no means linked only to its creator. By the time it appears, the work is already linked in a thousand subtle ways to the context in which it was published; to the people who worked on it; to the contemporary themes it touches; to the existing works it echoes and references. Over time, a new link establishes itself, that of the public who see the work and make it a part of their lives.</p>
<p>The integrity of the work of art, primarily of concern only to the artist, can become a concern of the public, as well. Furthermore, the opinions of the artist and the public might differ. And the public might even be right! A case in point is George Lucas‚Äô treatment of the original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy. These movies from the early 1970s were not only hugely popular, but were also influential on films that came after. Some 20 years after their release, Lucas wanted to remaster the films and re-release them in cinemas. Not only did he add elaborate computer-generated special effects, he also made changes to the script that erased some morally-dubious lines by ‚Äúgood‚Äù characters. Steven Spielberg did something similar with his re-release of <em>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</em> (1982), not only adding new special effects, but also overpainting guns with walkie-talkies for a less threatening atmosphere. In both cases, fans reacted furiously. After this episode, Spielberg changed his stance on how to deal with reissues of his movies, expressing the value of showing a work as it existed in its time. The conversation with the public changed Spielberg‚Äôs understanding of his own work.<sup>üìÉ quint, <em>AICN Exclusive: Spielberg Speaks! Jaws Blu-Ray in the Works with No ‚ÄòDigital Corrections‚Äô!</em></sup></p>
<p>The tight link between author and work can also pose a problem when it comes to the freedom of others to reference, adapt, remix and transform what you have produced. Within current copyright rules you, or whomever you assigned your copyright to, can control any use of your work. Moral rights allow for extra safeguards when work is reproduced. But as time goes by after the work is published and takes up its part in popular culture, you can wonder how justified leaving the control squarely with the artist and their representatives really is. I personally feel this control should be strongest at the point when you are first making your work public. If you‚Äôve written a short story decades ago, and it has since become part of general, popular culture, why would it be up to you to veto whether it gets adapted into a play, a graphic novel, a short movie or an arts installation? Whether you deserve a remuneration for such a re-use is another question still. It is possible to imagine a copyright where re-uses would still entitle you to a remuneration, but where you wouldn‚Äôt get to decide which work can be made and which work not. You‚Äôd be protected from yourself: you‚Äôd never become a censor.</p>
