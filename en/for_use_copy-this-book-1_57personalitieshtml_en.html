<h1>People have Rights too: Personalities</h1>
<p>Most of this book deals with copyright, which fixes how you can use existing cultural works and how you can control the reproduction of works you make yourself. Thereâ€™s more to art than art, though. Daily life, the people that inhabit it and the stories they tell are never-ending sources of inspiration. Yet the potential to make use of daily life is limited by the right of human individuals to privacy. To some extent, individuals have the right to determine what part of themselves is made public. That includes which details we share about our lives or when and how we want our name and likeness to be used. These rights are called personality rights.</p>
<p>Artists must respect other peopleâ€™s personality rights. OfÂ course, they must respect yours as well. If that friend-of-a-friend who took all those pictures of you while you were passed out at an after-party plans to exhibit them, this chapter might come in handy.</p>
<h2>Writing about other people</h2>
<p>Law aside, you feel the impact of making use of other peoplesâ€™ lives for material. Many a writer has seen their relationships with friends, lovers, family and business partners soured because the depicted did not like their depiction. The relation between art and life is delicate.</p>
<p>People have the right to prevent details about their private life being made public. In most cases, permission must be granted, though celebrities and public figures have less protection. Further, it is forbidden to write falsehoods about someone that could harm their reputation, this is called libel. Public figures benefit from this protection like anybody else. Even if your friend lied and cheated their way through art school, you cannot just write a book about their time in school because youâ€™d be sharing details of their private life without permission. If, however, that friend went on to be a famous painter, youâ€™d probably be able to publish such a book. In no case is it ever OK to tell such stories if your friend was actually honest and fair.</p>
<p>Fiction writers have a get out of jail free card: They do not claim to write the truth. At the same time, they tend to be inspired by people in their life. When the father of debuting novelist Emma Curvers recognised himself in the novelâ€™s father figure, he sued. An Amsterdam judge, denying the fatherâ€™s claims, wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is inevitable that authors of novels are inspired by true events and persons that actually exist (or have existed), since imagination feeds (partly) on real persons and events [â€¦] That does not change that they are works of fiction.<sup>âš– Rechtbank Amsterdam, <em>ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2015:45</em>.</sup> Their contents [â€¦] cannot be unnecessarily grieving towards a really-existing person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, fictionâ€™s insulation from personality rights is not absolute. A succession of German judges took the opposite stance from the Amsterdam courts with Maxim Billerâ€™s novel <em>Esra</em> (2003). Billerâ€™s ex-girlfriend and her mother were easily recognised as the inspiration.<sup>ðŸ“š Uwe Wittstock, <em>Der Fall Esra: ein Roman vor Gerichtâ€¯: Ã¼ber die neuen Grenzen der Literaturfreiheit</em>.</sup> The right of protection of their personality was deemed to be more important than Billerâ€™s artistic freedom, and the book could no longer be sold.</p>
<h2>Taking pictures of other people</h2>
<p>Everybody has a right to their own personality and is accorded some say in how it is depicted. If you take photographs you deal with this on a daily basis. You must make sure your subjects agree to be in the picture. But this is not a hard and fast rule. Whether someoneâ€™s permission is required depends on several factors. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the picture depict a newsworthy event? The publicâ€™s access to information often outweighs personality rights.</li>
<li>Is the depicted person a public figure? Politicians and movie stars are simply going to have to put up with more photographic attention than most.</li>
<li>How big a part of the picture does the person take up? Especially when photographing in a public place, it is hard to ask permission from all people involved. However, even in a public place, you are likely to have to deal with personality rights when taking a close-up of someone. Especially if this person is not famous or involved in a newsworthy event.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take a portrait, itâ€™s best to ask the photographed person to sign a model release form. This is a contract in which the person photographed agrees they will not use their personality rights to hinder the publication of the photo in the future. Contact the photographerâ€™s association of your country to find a release form template relevant to your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>When working with professional models, the situation is slightly different. Instead of asking the models to sign a release form, you usually sign a contract with their agency in advance of the shoot. The contract will probably not waive all personality rights, rather you will be able to use the photos for a specific, predetermined purpose. Modelling agencies will typically ask less money if the photos are destined to appear in a trade magazine than on a billboard.</p>
<p>If a picture you took gets published, it is the publisher who is then responsible for any infringements on personality rights. The publisher can still, however, try to hold you responsible for damages. To avoid this, always make it known to what extents personality rights have been cleared. Then the publisher is aware they are responsible for procuring further rights if necessary.</p>
